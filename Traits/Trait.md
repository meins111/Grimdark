## Overview
Traits provide a highly flexible way to attach additional information to a character, which do not fall easily under a [Specialty](/SkillSystem/Specialty.md), a [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md) and would be too small or vague to be a proper [Aces](/LevelUp/Ace.md).


> [!note] Origin Traits
> Note that every character created using the [Life Path Character Creation](/LifePath/Life%20Path.md) has a number of [Origin Traits](/Traits/Origin%20Trait.md). 


## Invoking Traits
Generally speaking, Traits can be invoked either by the player or the GM to argue whether a certain action is made at an [Advantage](/CoreSystem/Advantage.md) or [Disadvantage](/CoreSystem/Disadvantage.md).


> [!example]- Example: Invoking a Trait
> Sergej the ex-guardsman-now-inquisitorial-agent is tasked with infiltrating a local PDF base and collect insight information from the troopers and officers stationed there.
> Sergej's player notes that Sergej has the Trait [PDF Basic Training](/LifePath/CombatTraining/PDF%20Basic%20Training.md) from his Life Path and argues that he should feel right at home with that environment.
> The GM agrees and notes that Sergej will have Advantage on his checks to get into the base using PDF procedures and mix with the troops.
