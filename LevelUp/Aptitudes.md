## Overview
While a character's [Attribute](/CoreSystem/Attribute.md) describe his current state of body and mind, his Aptitudes describe his potential. When developing your character, whether it is raising one if your attributes, increasing the rating of one of your specialties or training a new [Ace](/LevelUp/Ace.md), your Aptitudes come into play. They determine how expensive it is to get that promotion: the more "matching" aptitudes you have, the cheaper the raise. But remember: in Grimdark you can learn pretty much anything if you put your mind to it.
Should you lack the proper Aptitudes, your character will simply have a much harder time. Some people are bookworms others are gym addicts, that's just the way we are. But if you are determined, even muscle can learn how to fill a Munitorum form correctly once in a while...

It is a simple fact that some people find it easier to train a certain Specialty, Profession or Ace than others. As you follow the [Life Path](/LifePath/Life%20Path.md) you pick up your character's Aptitudes.

## Two kinds of Aptitudes
* Single Aptitude: they share the name of one of the [Attributes](/CoreSystem/Attribute.md)
* Group Aptitude: they share the name with one of the four Profession groups: Physical, Instinctual, Social and Intellectual.
