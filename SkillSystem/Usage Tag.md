#CoreSystem #tags 
## Overview
Tags are attached to [Specialties](/SkillSystem/Specialty.md) and [Professions](/SkillSystem/Profession.md) to denote the ways they can be used in a very high level. This provides an implicit grouping of abilities, which may be used in a similar way and provide an attachment point for other game mechanics.

## Tags as Association
Tags also provide a grouping for Specialties or Professions which can be used to in a similar way, thus providing implicit grouping. This is useful in a variety of ways:
- Players can use Tags to quickly dig through their available tools to find one which is up for the job.
- Game mechanics may address only specific Tags. A Mind-Control effect may for example deny the target the use of anything with the [Physical Attack (PA)](</CoreSystem/Tags/Physical Attack.md>)
 - GMs may use Tags to abstractly request a certain type of Check from the players. E g. _"Debris is starting to fall from the cave's ceiling! Everyone do a [Physical Defense (PD)](</CoreSystem/Tags/Physical Defenses.md>) Check."_, rather than having to list the various available Specialties, which have the PD Tag.
