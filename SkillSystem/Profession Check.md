#CoreSystem #Professions 
## Overview
When a character tries something which does not fall under any specific [Specialty](SkillSystem/Specialties/Specialty.md), or he does not have the specific one trained, a Profession Check can be performed instead.

## When to use a Profession Check?
- When playing according to the [Generalist Playstyle](/SkillSystem/Generalist%20Playstyle.md), everyone is always using Profession Checks to make things happen. See: [Generalist vs Specialist Playstyle](CoreSystem/Generalist%20vs%20Specialist%20Playstyle.md) for more.
- Player's proposed action does not neatly Fall under any existing [Grimdark Specialty](SkillSystem/Specialties/List%20of%20Specialties.md) as listed.
- The character does not have a rank in the specific [Specialty](SkillSystem/Specialties/Specialty.md) but does have a rating of the associated [Profession](SkillSystem/Professions/Profession.md).

## How it works
1. Determine the [Profession](SkillSystem/Professions/Profession.md) to use. This step is only necessary when a player is improvising some action.
2. Determine the two best-fit [Attribute](/CoreSystem/Attribute.md) to use. If the Profession Check is used instead of an existing Specialty, the listed attributes should be used. Otherwise, the GM should work together with the player to quickly determine the most fitting attributes.
3. Roll the [Basic Check](CoreSystem/Basic%20Check.md). The [Profession Rating](SkillSystem/Profession%20Rating.md) is used as the check modifier.
