## Overview
Grimdark groups [Specialties](/SkillSystem/Specialty.md) into associated Professios. The primary use of Professions within the scope of Grimdark is to represent the fact that learning or training in one area, does provide you with some level of skill in closely related areas as well. 

Mechanically, this is represented by the [Profession Rating](</SkillSystem/Profession%20Rating.md>) - a numerical representation of your general capabilities with everything falling within the scope of that Profession. As your character is gaining ranks in Specialties, the character does also (slightly) increase his Profession Rating, which can be used in various, creative ways as described below.

## Using Professions
Professions facilitate creative play, as they provide an easy way to resolve a player's idea, which doesn't match any of the existing specialties. Instead of inventing a new Specialty, the player would then simply use a [Profession Check](</SkillSystem/Profession%20Check.md>). He is improvising and uses his general competence in the respective field to get the job done.

For players preferring reduced complexity, the [Generalist Playstyle](</SkillSystem/Generalist Playstyle.md>) offers a way to not dive deep into the details provided by Specialties instead of the more generalist approach. They can just use Professions all the time, ignoring Specialties for the most part. See [Generalist vs Specialist Playstyle](</CoreSystem/Generalist%20vs%20Specialist%20Playstyle.md>) for details on this.

## Professions Groups
Professions are grouped into four groups by the most influential and most used Attributed used by that Profession. Grimdark characters creation using the [Life Path](</LifePath/Life%20Path.md>) system, will gain one [Aptitude](</CoreSystem/Aptitudes.md>) matching the name of a Profession Group, reflecting their character's leanings.
