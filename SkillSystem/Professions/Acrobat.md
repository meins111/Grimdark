## Overview
Balance and careful, precise yet fast movement is the name of the game for the Acrobat. Whether it is to keep your footing during an earthquake or aboard a void ship under fire, backflipping away from a wild sword strike or rapidly moving over and around obstructed areas with the grace of a feline - getting a hold of an experienced Acrobat is a challenge.

## The Acrobat
... possesses a high level of body control and tension. His movements are fluid, every step measured and sure. Every gesture a study in precision and expressiveness. He may very well be considered handsome or beautiful, depending on local beauty ideas, due to his well balanced body shape, which is neither weak and sunken nor so swollen with muscles that his center if gravity is off.
