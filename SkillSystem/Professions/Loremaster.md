#Professions #Loremaster
## Overview
Knowledge is a tool of considerable power if used well. Knowing what to say and how to react when faced with a certain organization, cult or species alone can be a matter of life or death. As is the knowledge of advanced tactics on the battlefield or scientific principles when trying to determine a strange phenomena. And that is not to speak of the truly obscure knowledge of the occult, which - while undoubtedly incredibly powerful and invaluable - is able to corrupt and even break the mind of those too eager to learn ever more.

## The Loremaster
... seldom can withstand any opportunity to start a lengthy monologue about his field of expertise and drone on and on, going into levels of detail so minute as to bore pretty much anyone unfortunate enough to be listening. More often than not, Loremasters carry with them various dataslates, books, scrolls or other even more obscure items of knowledge and information storage.

> [!faq] Non-Imperial Characters
> The specialties presented above are oriented for imperial characters.
> Xenos and will likely have different Specialties.
> In particular _Imperium of Man_, _Cult Mechanicus_ and _Tacticia Imperialis_ would be a strange sight on a Xenos character sheet (although maybe not, if they make a point in actually studying the Imperium). In fact, the _Xenos_ specialty would (for them) cover those aspects regarding the Imperium.
> Player and GM should work together to come up with alternatives. A craftworld Eldar character may choose _Craftworld Eldar_ (replacing _Imperium of Man_) or an Ork may replace it with _Ork Kultur_.
