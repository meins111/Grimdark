#Professions #Survivalist
## Overview
The art of survival with but your bare hands, simple tools and your wits is a highly valuable one to have in case of sudden lack of civilization.

## The Survivalist
... in a civilized environment is not easy to detect. Maybe he has the habit of checking his surrounding nearly as careful as an Observer or has the habit of carrying around lots of baggage - just in case. But once you are in a desolate place, far from the benefits of civilization, there is no denying the aura of calm and competence of a true Survivalist. While you may worry about the dangers of the wilderness (which may also apply to what is left in the ruins of a civilized place), including thirst, hunger and wild animals, the Survivalist just seems ... home at last.
