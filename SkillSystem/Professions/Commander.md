## Overview
Leading others into (and hopefully back out of) danger is a hard yet utterly necessary profession in a galaxy where there is only war. 

## The Commander
... is an imposing figure. Not necessarily in a physical sense but the sheer air of authority and determination that is nearly palpable around him. Commanders with a formal military background usually have held (or still hold) a command rank and may display some Hallmark signs of strict military doctrine, such as short cropped hair (and beard), a stiff posture, well maintained gear and clothing as well as a clipped, commanding voice. Commanders usually come in one of three variants: those who are deeply trusted by their comrades, those who are feared and those who seriously outsmarts them.
