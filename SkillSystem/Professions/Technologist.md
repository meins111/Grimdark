#Professions #Technologist
## Overview
The marvel of Technology are beyond the grasp of the vast majority of humanity. But not for a Technologist. His is the task of maintaining, repairing and even creating the advanced technology without which humanity would be all but doomed in the grimdark future. 

## The Technologist
... may feel such a deep connection to technology, that he surrounds himself with it permanently - in the shape of mechanical augmentations and a flurry of gadgets, some hardwired to their body some only a swift grasp away.
Many a Technologist may look down at primitive technology or those less versed in the use and maintenance of that which he venerates.
