## Example Use Cases
- Basic shooting of a ranged weapon on some target aiming for [Center Mass](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Center%20Mass.md) for improved chances to actually scoring a hit (although most targets will wear some kind of armor, which usually is strongest there)
- [Sniping](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Sniping.md) a target over long ranges or targeting a very specific (and small) target, like the head, hand or wheel. Either way, sniping requires proper setup and time to aim and thus exposure.
- Mostly keeping in cover and only occasionally return fire ([Snapshot](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Snapshot.md))
- Quickly draw and fire a gun, discharge on reflex, shooting multiple targets in rapid succession ([Snapshot](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Snapshot.md))
- Effectively use weapons with an area of effect (grenade launchers, flamers, mortars) or sustained automatic fire to saturate an entire area with lethal ordnance ([Saturation Fire](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Saturation%20Fire.md))
- Clever, creative use of overwhelming firepower can achieve all kinds of results from blowing off locks to destabilizing walkways or bridges, scare animals or distract guards ([Trickshot](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Trickshot.md))
