## Overview
Brutally enforcing your will on others and punish all who stand against you, your principles or beliefs is your calling. You spread fear and terror to the foe and probably friend alike.

## The Enforcer
... is a hardened man, used to get his way and to have his orders obeyed to the letter. He is well used to deploying some measure of brutality (be it physical or mental in nature) in his endeavors. He may well be feared for his scrupulous approach and words, let alone the punishment he has ever ready for those that deny him. To stand up to an Enforcer is to face a brutal torturer of mind, body and soul. Most cannot withstand the unforgiving, razor sharp gaze of an Enforcerâ€™s cold eyes let alone keep their wits when he starts yelling at them.

## Example Use Cases
- [Terrify](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Terrify.md) others into doing your bidding - that won't make you a lot of long-term friends though...
- Be more scary than the scary thing overwhelming an ally [Terrify](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Terrify.md) - surely that cannot backfire...
- [Torture](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Torture.md) may not be the most sophisticated way if getting answers out of a target but it usually works nevertheless. Just don't expect them to invite you over to their next garden party...
- [Interrogate](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Interrogate.md) someone thoroughly to get information out of them. This relies more on cleverly worded questions and confronting them with evidence than the more brutal Torture - the two do however work quite efficiently together, as a weakened target will probably have a harder time hiding truths from an experienced Interrogator.
- [Blackmailing](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Blackmail.md) is another shady yet effective way to get others to do your bidding - obviously only works (well) if you actually have incriminating information or knowledge about them.
