#Professions #Warrior
## Overview
The primitive-advanced art of stabbing, slicing, hammering, bashing or bisecting another being with various kinds of Melee weaponry.

## The Warrior
... has a very real sense of danger around him. Whether he is fast and lean or brutally strong does matter little. The posture alone, in combination with cold, steely eyes tells the same either way: I am ready to kill you with a spoon, so do not mess with me.

## Example Use Cases
- Hit a target with all the power you can manage in a single, highly powerful [Hammerblow](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Hammerblow.md) - works best with heavy weapons
- Hit multiple close-by targets with a wild swing or keep targets from swarming you by sweeping motions ([Cleave](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Cleave.md))
- Clever movement or surprising tactic (often including ones surrounding) to outmaneuver or outhink an opponent has won many an otherwise uneven fight and if not a quick withdrawal might save the day! ([Combat Maneuver](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Combat%20Maneuver.md))
- [Fencing](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Fencing.md) is the art of dueling with careful offensive and watchful defense using parries and ripostes - difficult against multiple foes
-  Overwhelming an enemy with a rapid series of attacks is a proven if exhausting tactic of many advanced warriors favouring light and fast weaponry and speed over strength ([Lightning Strike](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Lightning%20Strike.md))
- Aiming for a specific body part, weak point or other can yield highly effective if difficult to get right results ([Lethal Strike](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Lethal%20Strike.md))
- Using Guns during hectic close combat requires quite a bit of training in the movements and tactics of the warrior instead of the those of a [Gunman](/SkillSystem/Professions/Gunman.md) more commonly associated with gun usage in addition to the right weapon ([Gunfoo](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Gunfoo.md))
