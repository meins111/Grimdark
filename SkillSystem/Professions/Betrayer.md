## Overview
Lies. Deception. Selfishness. Fake and Forgery. That is the Betrayer. 

## The Betrayer
... is entirely focused on his own personal benefits in any given situation and value other people only for the benefit he may gain from using them.The word of betrayer is worth as much as one might suspect and you better watch your goods when one is around. 
Of course it is far from easy to see a Betrayer for who he really is through the maze of twisted lies, half-truths and even physical disguises a Betrayer might wear. More often than not, a Betrayer has a likable face, his speech a honey-tinged sweet and his gesture's inviting and calming - everything intended to lower suspicions and alertness.
