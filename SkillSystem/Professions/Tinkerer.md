#Professions #Tinkerer
## Overview
Lacking thorough understanding of technology did never hinder people from using it.

## The Tinkerer
... may use tech on a daily basis, maybe even some rather advanced tech, but all he knows is how to use it, in the way he was once taught to - or even figured it all by out himself. Many Tinkerers proudly show off their skills, hoping to impress more careful people around them. And despite this being close to (or even definite) tech heresy, many Tinkerers fiddle around with common day or even advanced tech in their free time.
