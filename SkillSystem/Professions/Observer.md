#Professions #Observer
## Overview
An old saying goes as follow: it takes a good Observer to notice an Observer. Keen senses, long experience and good instincts come together to form an Observer.
Noticing the tiny details that give away a lie, ambush or hidden secret is the purview of an Observer.

## The Observer
... is walking into a room and the first thing he does is looking around with fast, practiced eye movements that seem to take in every last thing within, register and then file it for later. In a conversation or game of cards, you may notice that small smirk on his face when he sees through one of your bluffs - that is if you're lucky and he is not good at hiding those minute expressions himself.
