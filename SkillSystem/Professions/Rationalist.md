## Overview
Clear thought, reasoning capabilities and a highly capable mind are the trademarks of a Rationalist. He will be hard to influence unless with hard facts, be the first to unravel logic problems and quick to pick up new languages.

## The Rationalist
... is a rare breed in the grimdark future but yet he exists and tries his utmost to unravel the mysteries of the universe with but his sharp mind, pointed questions and clever methods. More often than not, a Rationalist will show great interest in the "why" of any given situation. Others love to berate those around them and take any chance to share their knowledge and understandings of literally anything they might encounter as if compelled to by a supreme force.
