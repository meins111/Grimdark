## Overview
Knowing your way around and not getting lost is a highly valuable skill. Figuring out a way around an obstacle can safe everyone involved from a lot of trouble as well.

And then there are the Navis Nobilitae, the mutants, able to perceive the warp with their signature third eye and the only ones able to properly steer a warp ship through the warp and thus one of the three key elements allowing imperial ships to travel faster than light. 

## The Navigator
... has this air of competence you would expect from a native of a certain place - even though they never were here before. They walk through a maze of corridors and stairs like an open field and will always know the shortest route, most likely using a bunch of personal shortcuts, to anywhere of importance. Some may habitually carry some tools with them, like foldable maps or even a portable cartographer unit, maybe only a simple compass or sextant.

## Example Use Cases
- Plot a short / safe / stealthy / unsuspicious path to a locatuon
	- On the [Surface](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Surface%20Navigation.md) of a world, relying on visible landmarks, the horizon, the position of the sun or stars, memorable locations, etc
	- Within tunnel systems or [man-made structures](</SkillSystem/Specialties/Enclosed Navigation.md>) such as hives or void ships, relying mostly on a keen sense of hearing and smelling, marks and signs left behind by others (or yourself) and points of interest
	- Within [voidspace](</SkillSystem/Specialties/Void Navigation.md>), in particular within a solar system where distances are measured in hundreds of thousands of kilometers and even tiny course corrections cause massive changes in trajectory 
- Stop getting lost or recover from loosing your bearing
- Creating maps of a certain area for others to follow or aid in your own, future navigation checks ([Cartographing](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Cartographing.md))
- Plot a course through the warp ([Warp Navigation](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Warp%20Navigation.md)) - warp eye mutation not included but required!
- Quickly figure out a way around an obstacle
