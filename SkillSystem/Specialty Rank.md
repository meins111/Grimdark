#Specialties #CoreSystem #CharacterSheet 
## Overview
The rank of a Specialty determines the modifier you gain when using it for a [Basic](/CoreSystem/Basic%20Check.md) or [Opposed Check](/CoreSystem/Opposed%20Check.md).

## The Ranks
0. **Clueless**: You have no idea of this specialty and cannot use it unless your GM allows you to do some _clueless dabbing_ (see below).
1. **Novice**: You have some first experience with it and can start using it. You gain a **+3 modifier**.
2. **Ordinary**:  You have a decent understanding of your specialty, enough to manage fairly well under normal circumstances. You gain a **+6 modifier**.
3. **Expert**: You are held in high regarded within your Specialty. You gain a **+12 modifier**.
4. **Master**: You are widely renowned for your mastery in this field. You gain a **+15 modifier**.
5. **Legend**: You are known far and wide for your proficiency within this specialty and sought after by powerful organizations and individuals for employment. You gain a **+18 modifier** and may **reroll one [Basic Roll](CoreSystem/Basic%20Roll.md)**.


## Clueless Dabblings
Depending on circumstances and the Specialty in question, GMs may allow the use of a Rank 0 Specialty.

In such a case, resolve the Check as usual, with a modifier of 0, but with the additional limitation that the best [Outcome](/CoreSystem/Trinary%20Outcome.md) a Clueless Dabbler can manage is a Partial Success.
