#CoreSystem #Specialties
## Overview
Specialty is a very specific skill your character has invested a serious amount of time and effort developing, training and honing. Each specialty provides the GM with a set of mechanics and rules for using the Specialty - or, by extension, the use of a [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md) in the respective way.
Each Specialty will also provide a few examples of how or when to use it and suggestions on appropriate [Complications](/SkillSystem/Complications.md), that may occur upon a Failure or Partial Success.


>[!faq] Too many Specialties?
>If you look at the number of available Specialties in Grimdark, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Don't be! Grimdark explicitly offers many Specialties which are similar in their general use-case but quite distinct on a flavour and roleplay level. 
>This is to say, you will not need nor should you in fact strive to learn all the Specialties offered by the game but instead mix and match those Specialties which fit your character well and ignore the rest!
>And should you still feel like it is too much, there is always the option to play the [Generalist](/SkillSystem/Generalist%20Playstyle.md).
