## Overview
Specialty is a very specific skill your character has invested a serious amount of time and effort developing, training and perfecting. It also provides the GM with a set of mechanics and rules for using the Specialty - or, by extension, the use of a [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md) in the respective way.

Each Specialty will also provide a few examples of how or when to use it and suggestions on appropriate [Complications](/SkillSystem/Complications.md), that may occur upon a Failure or Partial Success.
