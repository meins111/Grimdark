#Professions #CharacterSheet #CoreSystem 
## Overview
Measurement of the Generalist ability of a character within a given [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md). Gained indirectly by increasing [ranks](/SkillSystem/Specialty%20Rank.md) of associated [Specialties](/SkillSystem/Specialty.md). Once unlocked it can be used as the modifier for a [Basic](/CoreSystem/Basic%20Check.md) or [Opposed Check](/CoreSystem/Opposed%20Check.md) when improvising a creative usage of a Profession or to substitute for a missing or lackluster Specialty as discussed in [Profession Check](/SkillSystem/Profession%20Check.md).

## How to Use
> Simply add the Rating (if any!) as your modifier to a Check. 
> You can only use your Profession Rating if you have a positive value.


## When to Use
> See [Profession Rating](</SkillSystem/Profession%20Check.md#When to use a Profession Check?>)

## How to raise it
That is the neat part: you don't! It is raised by one automatically whenever you gain a rank in any associated Specialty and **unlocked as soon as you have three or more ranks**.

Forgot what your rating is? Just count up the ranks in all associated Specialties - done!
> Profession Rating = # Specialty Ranks


> [!example] Profession Rating Example
> Sergej had served several years in the Imperial Guard and thus gained insight in the various ways of handling a gun. He has 3 Ranks in "Center Mass", 2 in "Saturation Fire" and 2 in "Sniping". This means he has a total of 7 Ranks within the Gunman Profession. As he has more than 3, he has unlocked the Profession Rating for Gunman and can use the Rating (7) if he wants to use one of the Gunman specialties he has not trained - like "Trick Shot".
