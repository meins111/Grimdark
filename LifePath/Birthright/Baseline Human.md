#CharacterCreation #Birthright
## Overview
While the multitude of environments inhabited by men in the grim-dark future has all put pressure on the millennia old, sacred form of humanity, the vast, vast majority of all living people are still recognizably human in appearance and ability.

## Baseline Attribute Spread
* Same for all [Attributes](/CoreSystem/Attribute.md):  **20+4d5**
>[!faq]+ Three Ways to roll for Attributes
> 1. **Roll**: In order of the attributes, roll one set and note down the values for each attribute in turn. This approach is best for players going into character creation without a clear idea what they want to play and "go with the flow" or "discover" their character.
> 2. **Roll-then-Swap-Two**: Start with the Roll method. Once finished, you may swap two sets of attributes. E.g., swapping the rolled values for Brutality with Precision and Cunning with Toughness. This method is a "middle-of-the-road" option, where you can follow character creation letting your character grow organically but then change around some stats to better represent his strength an weaknesses.
> 3. **Roll-then-Assign**: Roll seven times, then freely assign the values you got to the seven attributes. This works best for players with a strong vision of the character they want to play.
