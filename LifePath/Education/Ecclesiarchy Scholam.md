## Description
The church is organizing many scholams throughout the Imperium, taking in many children who would otherwise not receive any formal, organized education at all.
In turn, the Ecclesiarchy can make sure to spread and proper teaching of the Imperial Creed from an early age.
Ecclesiarchy scholams are often strict and sometimes even brutal, especially to the curious minded - blessed are the ignorant after all.
