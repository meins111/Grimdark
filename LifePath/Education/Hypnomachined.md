## Description
Relicts of the dark age of technology, hypno-teaching devices are able to transfer  knowledge into subjects within the matter of weeks or months, which would take years if not decades of more traditional teaching. Hypnomachines are commonly deployed by the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Adeptus Astartes to quickly train and indoctrinate their neophytes.
And yet this method was never intended to replace actual learning and understanding, as hard facts alone are often not enough in the real world. Hypomachined characters often lack instinctive grasp of topics they _just know_ in a formal sense and may sometimes appear wooden in conversations.
