#CharacterCreation #life-path #early-career 
## Description
A career in the Administratum brings with it shuffling of data cores and paperstacks in search for tithing reports, calls for aid from planets long since dead and supply and reassignment requests from Regiments long since destroyed.
And yet, without this monotone, impossible work done by the legion of scribes of the Administratum _nothing_ would ever get done. No reinforcements mustered and sent. No supplies gathered and provided. No new Regiments founded or Astartes Chapters created. No tithes collected and no new colonies created. The Imperium would halt to a stop that would be its certain death.
