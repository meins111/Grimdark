## Description
The imperial assassins have a massive organization at their shrouded backs, collection information, assigning targets, managing recruitment and training regimes as well as ensuring transport and recovery of its members.
Your early career has seen you enter the service of the most clandestine Officio as either a novice operative or (more likely) one its analysts and spies.
Whatever the case, keep in mind that at this stage you certainly are not a proper assassin yet, nor have you received any of the administrations performed by the various temples.
