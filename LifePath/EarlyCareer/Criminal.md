## Description
You are or were scum, leeching of imperial society in any way imaginable. Maybe you are part of a black market ring of trafficking illicit goods like xeno artifacts or rogue psykers. Maybe your an even lower criminal of a hive gang, pillaging and thieving from your fellow hivers. Maybe you are a scribe leeching off the massive funds running over your desk to finance your secret substance abuse or regular joy girl visitations. Maybe your a murderous psychopath hiding in the noble uniform of a guardsman to m√ºder and torture to your hearts content...
