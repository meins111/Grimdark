## Description
You make a living off hunting prey - be they game animal, exotic wildlife, xenos or your fellow human (e.g. as a bounty hunter or hired killer).
This is a mostly solitary career, spent far removed from the teeming mass of civilization even if the separation is one of the mind and the hunter is actually walking right among the mass of a hive world.
