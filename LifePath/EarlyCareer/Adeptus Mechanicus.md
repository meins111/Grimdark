## Description
You are a sanctioned if low-ranking member of the priesthood of Mars. Maybe an Enginseer or simple Tech Adept, certainly no Magos (yet).
The martians price knowledge and technology above all else - often to the detriment of empathy and social skills regarding their fellow, non-induced humans. As they progress further down the road of this career, most continue to replace more and more parts of their natural body with machine parts and augmentics - which widens the gap between them and the majority of humanity ever further.
