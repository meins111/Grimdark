#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
Your homeworld has, at some point, fallen far, far back in its technological and social level, most likely following an extended period of being cut-off from the wider Imperium, maybe even dating back to old night itself.

The average level of civilization of your home is that of the stone or bronze age period. There is little in the way of big cities or even towns and mankind is struggling against the many dangers of nature to even survive here. 
Your home is classified as a death world and only the most hardy or lucky survive their childhood.
