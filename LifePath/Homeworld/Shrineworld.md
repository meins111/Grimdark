## Description
Your homeworld contains one (or many) sacred shrines, reliquiae or holy sights important enough to warrant a massive Ecclesiarchy presence. The governor may even be an arch-bishop and thus officially a part of the holy synod of Terra itself.

One thing is sure: you got to grew up surrounded by highly embellished architecture, cathedrals, entire hosts of pilgrims and faithful as well as the ever present sounds of bells, hymnals and praying.
