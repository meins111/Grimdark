## Description
These are the corn baskets of the Imperium, producing unbelievable amounts of foodstuff to be exported to feed worlds unable to do themselves, e.g. Hive Worlds and Forgeworlds. Usually these worlds have a low population density in favor of wide ranges of farmland, game forests and fish-filled rivers and oceans. You probably were raised stalking game animal in dense forests, feed the endless herds of farm animal or operate massive field machines cutting down corn.
