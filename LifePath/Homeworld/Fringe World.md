#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
Your homeworld is at the very edge of Imperial space, far off the major trade hubs, warp routes and other points of intergalactic interest. 
It may be that your world was only recently (in galactic terms) (re-)colonized. 
Whatever the case, your world is where imperial maps end and many older or more coarse maps, will not even have your world on it.
Places such as this, often attract a certain type of visitors. Criminals, borderline Heretics, abhumans, rogue traders, bounty hunters and other strangers.
Yet other Fringe Worlds try to make up for their relative unimportance by dialing up the religious zealotry by another level, striving to catch the eye of the powerful (and wealthy) Ecclesiarchy by doing so.
