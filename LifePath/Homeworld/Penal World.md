#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
Your homeworld is an intergalactic prison, where other worlds dump their criminal, traitors and other unwanted people. 
Or your world was declared a penal world after a (failed) uprising and rightful censure was enacted upon it.
Life on a penal world is purposefully harsh. Its inhabitants may be used as forced labor for mining operations or in heavy industries. Or they may be mercilessly drafted into the various arms of the imperial military to take on the most hazardous and lethal roles available - be it as a deck rating in the low-decks of an imperial navy ship or as cannon fodder in a penal legion imperial guard regiment.
