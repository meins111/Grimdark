## Description
Your family was nomadic, never staying in one place for any lengthy amount of time. It may be that they were part of a crusading force, a wandering circus or merchantman or even a roaming hunter-gatherer tribe.
Whatever the case, you have seen more places and different people in your youth than most imperial citizens will in a lifetime.
