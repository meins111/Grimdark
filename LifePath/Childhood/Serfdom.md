## Description
Your family was in a state of intended servitude to a powerful family, dynasty or organisation. This may be an ancient, honorable position of man-servant and maiden. Or it might be plain slavery by a power hungry, ruthless and hated overlord. Or it might even be as a chapter serf of an Adeptus Astartes chapter. Or just one of a Billion wage-slaves within the dystopian sprawl of a hive city.
Whatever the circumstances: life and work was hard and unrelenting.
