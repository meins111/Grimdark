#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
You grew up neglected or even outright abandoned by your parents, family and the majority of the local community. You had to get by mostly alone and had to trust in brute strength and instinct above all. At best you (eventually) decided that you would do your damned best to rise above your origin. At worst, you took to the bad habbits and behavior of those around you.
