#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
Your family, whatever it may have originally been, was torn apart by war and suffering. Whether your family was actually killed or you were "just" separated never to see each other again does little comfort.
Your early years were filled with fear, depredations and life threatening dangers ranging from actual combat to securing the basic needs of survival like food and water.

This has left a hard, uncompromising streak in your character that may be very much on the surface or deeply burrowed, until a time of need.
