#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
You were raised secluded from your environment, barely if ever seeing other children and people in general. 
Maybe you are a priced scion of a noble or powerful family and are kept within the palace grounds. Or your family is living far off any community.
Whatever the case, your early years were spent in a very tiny bubble and you had very little inkling of the big world beyond those limiting boundaries.
