#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Description
You come from a very martial minded family, maybe one (or both) your parents were in the Imperial Guard or Navy or PDF. Maybe your people are a militaristic tribe of a feudal world or enforcers in an Underhive plagued by gang wars.

Whatever they were or are, you were raised in just such a fashion too. It is likely that you knew how to handle a combat knife or gun before (if ever) learning to read and physical training was part of your everyday life.
