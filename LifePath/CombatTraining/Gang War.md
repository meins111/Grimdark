## Description
You participated in a prolonged, bloody gang war, either as a ganger, local militia or local law enforcement.  Fighting dirty was the norm and no man or woman a non-combatant. A favourite tactic during the fighting was the drive-by: massed indiscriminate shooting from a fast moving vehicle at enemy gang members or law enforcers or their families.
