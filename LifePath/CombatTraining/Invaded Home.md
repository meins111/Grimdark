## Description
Your home (either homeworld or some other place you considered your home) was invaded by external foes at some point. You and your fellows fought tooth and nail over every scrap of ground.
This brutal fighting taught you some lessions in resilience and persistence few others can match or understand. You may also be very particular when it comes to whatever place you now call home, like a habit of setting up strong defenses wherever you go or never settling down anywhere.
