## Overview
In a galaxy where there is only war, the vast majority of people have come to experience violence and fighting one way or another until the time they have come of age or soon after. For some, this experience may have come in the form of (more or less) safe combat training and simulations, while for many more it was the real, bloody, scary deal of kill or be killed - whether against their fellow men, hostile wildlife or invaders.
