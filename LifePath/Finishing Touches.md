#CharacterCreation #life-path 
## Overview
Congratulations to your new Grimdark character! Before jumping into whatever madness lies ahead of you, take a moment to consider your creation. Take one step back and review the outcome and compare it to a couple of points.

## Review : Background Traits
Let's start by checking out the bullet-point list of [Origin Traits](/Traits/Origin%20Trait.md). These are gained during your Life-Path decisions.
- Does the sequence of events seem believable and fitting for the setting (40k in general and the one prepared by your GM in particular)?
- Do they naturally morph into a neat, minimalistic background story?
- Does the backstory fit to the character concept you had or now have in your mind?

## Review: Professions
Then let us consider what the character is able to do. We will do this by having a closer look at the three Professions with the highest [Profession Rating](/SkillSystem/Profession%20Rating.md). 

> [!question]- What even are these Professions?
> If you are new to Grimdark and just jumped right into the creation process and went with what sounds most interesting (awesome, keep going!), then this is a good time to check out the descriptions of those three [Professions](/SkillSystem/Professions/List%20of%20Professions.md). Each entry has a section describing common demeanor and possibly even appearances of people working the respective Profession, as well as a short list of use-cases. This is intended to give you good general idea and is **not** a strict rule of course!

Let A, B and C be the three Professions in descending order (so A is the one with the highest Rating). Now consider the following sentence (and replace A, B and C with the respective Professions of your character):

> - He is a professional A.
> - He is a seasoned B.
> - He is a decent C.

Say these three sentences out loud (or in your mind). Then ask yourself whether this sounds like a probable, consistent and coherent character. It is also a good point to consider whether he matches the concept you set out to implement or not (and if not, whether you are fine with that fact).

## Review: Your "Toolbox"
To make sure that you have a well-rounded set of Specialties, we should make sure that your "toolbox" is well equipped. 

This is to say: does your character have at least one Specialty with the following [Usage Tags](/SkillSystem/Usage%20Tag.md)?
- Mental Defense (to protect you from mental influence)
- Physical Defense (to protect you from physical attacks)
- Mental Attack (to influence and put mental Stress on others)
- Physical Attack (to harm others)
- Solution (general problem solving: the more the better)


> [!hint] Example scenes and how to approach them
> In addition to the above, you may want to go through the following short list of sample scenes and consider how your character would approach them or attempt to resolve them - and whether he is any good in doing so. Note that it is totally fine if your character's answer to any of that is _"Nope, imma outa here"_ - but it is important that you think about various kind of situations.
> - A closed door. You have to get through. And no: you don't have the proper key.
> - A patrol of traitor militia is coming your way. They do not suspect your presence (yet).
> - You have to find a certain person within a few hab blocks.
> - An Ork is charging you.
> - You find an old tome written in an arcane language. You feel a certain, persistent yet inexplicable urge to open and read aloud from its pages.
> - A troublesome bureaucrat nitpicking at your filled-out triplicates you require to get an important permission/ item/ whatever.

## Review: Sanity Check
One last series of quick checks:
- No Specialty above Rank 3?
- No Attributes higher than your [Birthright's Limits](/LifePath/Birthright/Birthright.md)?
- Main Attributes of your highest Profession are at least decent? Each [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md) has a list in its description.
