#CharacterCreation #MainPages
## Overview
Grimdark characters are created by following their life path. Beside granting various [Attribute](</CoreSystem/Attribute.md>) modifiers as well as [Professions](SkillSystem/Profession.md) and [Specialties](SkillSystem/Specialty.md) points, the selected options double as a short list of bullet points describing the character's backstory. GMs and players are encouraged to invoke aspects of a characters backstory in fitting situations to make things easier (or harder).

## How it works
To create a character in Grimdark, players will traverse the different [Life Path Stages](</LifePath/Life%20Path%20Stages.md>) one by one. The very first step ([Birthright](</LifePath/Birthright/Birthright.md>)) provides a baseline character, which then becomes more fleshed out as we follow him through the life path. 

Each step of the way will have various options to choose from, but each of those options provide the same amount of character creation effects. For example, all options within the second Step ([Homeworld](</LifePath/Homeworld/Homeworld.md>)) will give two positive and one negative Attribute modifier.

The following general considerations apply:
1. If you intent to play using the [Generalist Playstyle](</SkillSystem/Generalist Playstyle.md>) and you get a [Specialty](SkillSystem/Specialty.md), simply put a dot next to the associated Profession.
2. If you gain the same [Specialty](SkillSystem/Specialty.md) from subsequent stages, you simply increase its [Specialty Rank](</SkillSystem/Specialty Rank.md>) by one.
3. Within one Stage, you may not select the same Specialty or Profession more than once.
4. Make sure to note down the options you took for each stage. These are your [Origin Traits](</Traits/Origin Trait.md>), which can be invoked during play to gain modifiers.

## Cooperative Character Creation
Depending on the setting your GM has in mind, he may limit some of the available choices in any of the life path steps. If his story is about the rise and fall of an Underhive gang, a righteous enforcer of the Arbitrators simply doesn't fit in easily.
Additionally, you may want to cooperate with your fellow players during Character creation, building some ties into each other's backstory. Maybe you are all from the same [Homeworld](</LifePath/Homeworld/Homeworld.md>), or have gone through basic PDF training together ([Combat Training](</LifePath/CombatTraining/Combat Training.md>))? Maybe one is a long lost [Childhood](</LifePath/Childhood/Childhood.md>) friend or you were former rivals for the same position during your [Early Career](</LifePath/EarlyCareer/Early Career.md>)?
