## Overview
Grimdatk characters are created by following their life path. Beside granting various [Attribute](<Attribute.md>) modifiers as well as [Profession](<Profession.md>) and [Specialty](<Specialty.md>) points, the selected options double as a short list of bullet points describing the character's backstory. GMs and players are encouraged to invoke aspects of a characters backstory in fitting situations to make things easier (or harder).

## How it works


## Cooperative Character Creation
Depending on the setting your GM has in mind, he may limit some of the available choices in any of the life path steps. If his story is about the rise and fall of an underhive gang, a righteous enforcer of the Arbitrators simply doesn't fit in easily.
Additionally, you may want to cooperate with your fellow players during Character creation, building some ties into each other's backstory. Maybe you are all from the same [Homeworld](<Homeworld.md>), or have gone through basic PDF training together ([Combat Training](<Combat Training.md>))? Maybe one is a long lost [Childhood](<Childhood.md>) friend or you were former rivals for the same position during your [Early Career](<Early Career.md>)?
