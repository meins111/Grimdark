#CharacterCreation 
## Overview
What your character was born as or was made to be on a biological level. 
The most fundamental aspect of your character.
It will determine the baseline of his [Attribute](</LifePath/Attribute.md>) spread and even more importantly his (natural) limits.

It does also have, quite obviously, fundamental roleplay implications and narrative limitations.  A Space Marine will stand out as a Space Marine in pretty much any circumstance, which may or may not be helpful for the players intentions for example.

## Character Creation Effect
* Attribute Baseline: your character's Birthright decides the starting [Attribute](</LifePath/Attribute.md>) scores. During the later [Life Path](</LifePath/Life Path.md>) steps, those baseline scores will be further adjusted.
* Attribute Limits: there is a natural limit to what can be achieved by training and experience alone. Characters can increase their [Attribute](</LifePath/Attribute.md>) only up to those [Attribute Limit](</LifePath/Attribute Limit.md>) indicated by their birthright using natural means of [Character Development](</LifePath/Character Development.md>). [Going beyond Limits](</LifePath/Going beyond Limits.md>) is possible but requires specific means which may or mau not be readily available for a given character.
