## Overview
Borderline believers can only be considered to adhere to their nominal [Faith](/LifePath/Faith/Faith.md) in the most broad and superficial way. Maybe his beliefs and practices are even further removed than that of a [Deviant](/LifePath/Faith/Deviant.md) or maybe he is on the verge of converting to another Faith altogether. Whatever the case, he is living a dangerous life for if he were to found out, he is likely to face dire consequences from the majority of true believers.

## The Borderline and Others
Borderline's are living a dangerous life, as both the [Zealous](/LifePath/Faith/Zealous.md) and the [Faithful](/LifePath/Faith/Faithful.md) will likely act harshly once they find him out. Plus, they are not truly [Heretical](/LifePath/Faith/Heretical.md) (yet?) so they do not even have the chance to get assistance from believers of another Faith.


## Advantages and Disadvantages
Swaying a borderline using baseline rhetoric is very hard indeed if not pointless to begin with
