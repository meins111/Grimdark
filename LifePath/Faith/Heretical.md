## Overview
The heretic has, by deed and or belief, left what could be considered following his nominal [Faith](/LifePath/Faith/Faith.md) even by the most generous terms. In fact, it is more than likely that he is at this point, actually, secretly following another Faith altogether. In which case he may take another Faith and Degree of Faith Trait to mark his true, secret allegiance.


> [!faq] Multiple Faith Traits
> In the more common case of single Faith, it is easiest to have Faith and Degree of Faith as two separate Traits. 
> This does not work well with multiple Faiths, so instead players should note down paired Traits of Faith and Degree of Faith.
> E.g. "God Emperor - Heretical", "Chaos - Faithful"


## The Heretical and Others
If uncovered, Heretics are sure to draw the dangerous attention of true believers and associated authorities - should he survive long enough for them to actually get involved...


## Advantages and Disadvantages
A heretic is practically impossible to sway using the beliefs of the Faith he has abandoned so thoroughly. 
He also can never use the [Faith Specialty](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Faith.md) to resist mental influence (using the nominal Faith). He may however use it with another Faith as normal - this will however (usually) reveal his true Faith (see the description of the Faith Specialty for details).
