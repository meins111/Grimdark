This stage apparently gives little modifiers compared to others, but the [Origin Traits](Traits/Origin%20Trait.md) gained by your choice in this stage can be crucial in many situation.

## Public Faith and Degrees of Faith
In this Stage, you will actually make two choices and get two Traits.
1. First, you choose the Public Faith you are officially, publicly adhere to. These are the big players of the Warhammer universe, like the worship of the God Emperor or the Chaos God(s).
2. Then you get to choose your personal degree of Faith, which is your character's very private stance on the matter and may be a well kept secret. The Degrees of Faith are the same for all Faiths.
