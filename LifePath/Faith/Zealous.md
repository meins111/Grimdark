## Overview
Zealous believers are consumed by their [Faith](/LifePath/Faith/Faith.md) and will use any chance to proudly and loudly proclaim, spread and enforce it. 

## The Zealous and Others
Zealots are more than likely to react extremely (potentially violently) towards Believers of another Faith or towards those of their own Faith he considers [Deviant](/LifePath/Faith/Deviant.md), [Borderline](/LifePath/Faith/Borderline.md) or even [Heretical](/LifePath/Faith/Heretical.md).


## Advantages and Disadvantages
Zealots are most easily swayed by religious oratory or propaganda. This may be both a positive or negative thing, depending on who tries to influence the character to what end.

A clear advantage is their practically unrestricted ability to use their [Faith Specialty](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Faith) to shield themselves from most mental influence.
