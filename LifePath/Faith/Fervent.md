## Overview
Fervent believers, while a step less extreme than a Zealot, are still Rock-Solid in their [Faith](/LifePath/Faith/Faith.md) and are still likely to try and spread the word wherever they go.

## The Fervent and Others
Fervents can readily be triggered to participate in extreme actions towards Believers of another Faith or towards those of their own Faithbthey would consider [Borderline](/LifePath/Faith/Borderline.md) or [Heretical](/LifePath/Faith/Heretical.md), but will not usually start such actions on their own. They are however, more then ready to bring such discoveries or transgressions to the attention of responsible authorities.


## Advantages and Disadvantages
The fervent are still quite easily swayed by religious oratory or propaganda. This may be both a positive or negative thing, depending on who tries to influence the character to what end.
