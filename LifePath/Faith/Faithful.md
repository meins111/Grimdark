## Overview
The Faithful typically make up the bulk of all believers of a given [Faith](/LifePath/Faith/Faith.md). They belief and strive to follow the tenets of it and abide by the sermons and demands of religious authorities. Typically less likely to go out if their way to preach and spread the word, the Faithful is nevertheless a true believer and hard to sway from their Faith.

## The Faithful and Others
The Faithful is usually a somewhat passive member of it's Faith, participating in services and celebrities but unlikely to autonomously act unless faced with obvious signs of the [Heretical](/LifePath/Faith/Heretical.md). Even then, without getting fired up by some of the more extreme elements of their Faith (like a [Zealot](/LifePath/Faith/Zealous.md)) they will rather report the issue than act impulsively on their own.


## Advantages and Disadvantages
Faithful can readily be swayed by religious oratory or propaganda. This may be both a positive or negative thing, depending on who tries to influence the character to what end.
