## Description
The Imperial Creed, spread and maintained with an iron fist by the Ecclesiarchy, is a grim Faith dealing in absolutes and hatred.
- The absolute, divine power of the God Emperor of Mankind, sitting on the Golden Throne on Holy Terra
- The absolute manifest destiny of the human race, reducing all Xenos to an annoying roadblock at best and abhorrent pest, deserving nothing but extermination and extinction at average.
- The absolute hatred for the trinity of mankind's enemies: the xeno, the witch and the heretic.
