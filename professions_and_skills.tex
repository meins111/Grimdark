\chapter{Professions \& Specialties}
	Grimdark's skill system is divided into so-called Professions, which group associated Specialties together. Raising a certain Specialty will also raise the profession rating, which can be used in place of any Specialty of a Profession. 
	This represents the fact that specialists are also (somewhat) proficient in their general field of expertise.\\
	A renown surgeon for cybernetic replacements is certainly also quite capable at first aid treatments after all, and a famous climber is quite likely a dangerous wrestler as well...
	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\begin{DndReadAloud}
		{\large\textbf{Generalist or Specialist Path?}}\\\noindent
		The number of Specialties featured in Grimdark is quite large (and might even grow in your game!), so it is easy to feel overwhelmed.
		It is totally acceptable to completely set aside Specialties for your first (or any) character and only use the more general Professions instead! Grimdark calls this the \textbf{Generalist} path.
		Whenever the GameMaster calls for a Specialty check, he should also announce the respective Profession.
		If you choose to follow the Generalist path, you will just make the respective Profession check and you're good - the GM will apply the respective Modifiers of the Specialty and resolve the action.
	\noindent
		Should you prefer the delve deeper into Grimdark's skill system and manage each individual Specialty, you are set to follow the \textbf{Specialist} path.
		The Specialist path provides the option to fiddle with every last bit of your character, and can be seen as a tool for advanced players (or those who like a complex system) to tweak and customize their characters even further and make them truly unique.

\section{Professions} % (fold)
	\label{sec:professions}
	A Profession represent the generalist ability of a character in a certain broad area of expertise.
	Each Profession covers a range of Specialties which are somewhat related.
	In addition, they provide a fast and loose overview of the character.
	Is he a brutal underhive ganger with high scores in the Betrayer, Athlete and Warrior professions?
	Or an ancient tech priest with a more accumulated knowledge in his left (augmented) toe, than a handful of highborn nobles put together, reflected by his  Tinkerer, Technologist and Logic professions?
	\begin{DndSidebar}{Profession Example}
		\textit{Sister Aryanna of the Ordo Dialogis and her death-cult comrade Krill'Ta are attempting to infiltrate a gathering of noblewomen of the Hive World Olrabus, suspecting the machinations of a genestealer cult in its midst. As a distrustful guard is denying them entrance, a hasty debate between the two members of the Inquisitors retinue using Ordo hand signs erupts. Should Aryanna attempt to tell a convoluted (and utterly crafted) story to convince the guard - or should Krill'Ta attempt to seduce the guard with her death world charm?\\\noindent
		Both would be valid approaches, but seducing the guard may take Krill'Ta out of the next scene and leave the sister alone in the midst of the noblewomen. On the other hand, sister Aryanna isn't particular known for her abilities to lie - an ability which is far from well-perceived by her Ordo after all...\\}
	\end{DndSidebar}

	One central decision of Grimdark, contrary to many other game systems, is the fact that it does not assume that player characters or even a group of player characters, cover all or even most professions. 
	There are many different ways to tackle any given situation scattered over the different professions that may appear redundant on a purely mechanical take.
	But each profession has its very own take and spin on "their" solution to a problem, along with certain role-play implications, limitations and situational modifiers.
	Thus a certain given situation may be much easier to solve by one profession than by another - yet they all have their uses, without forcing someone to break out of character to tackle a certain solution.

	On a mechanical level, Professions work (mostly) like Specialties, with the main difference is the fact that you cannot raise Professions directly and use a different modifier.
	The roll modifier when using a Profession is determined by the current Profession rating (see below).

	\begin{figure}[hb]
		\begin{DndReadAloud}
		\textbf{Design Decision: Professions}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Facilitate Player Creativity}: If a player has an idea, which is not covered by the existing Specialties, it is usually easy to discern the Profession to which the described action relates. Having the option to roll a Profession check in such a case, allows for great player creativity. GM and Players are encouraged to develop new Specialties for commonly used actions of players that are not foreseen by Grimdark.
			\item \textbf{Make Everyone a Generalist}: In many skill-based game systems, players may end up with specialist characters which are very proficient in skill A but absolutely untrained in skill B, although the two skills are actually quite closely related. This does not make a whole lot of sense, as every specialist is also necessarily a generalist in his field of purview - at least to some degree.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{DndReadAloud}
	\end{figure}

\subsection{The Profession Rating}
	Each profession has a certain Profession rating, representing the total ability of the character in that Profession. 
	This rating \textbf{increases by 2 for each new Specialty level learned} in an associated Specialty.

\subsection{The Profession Check}
	A Profession check works just like a Specialty check with a single difference.
	Instead of using the respective Specialty modifier, it uses the Profession Rating.
	Everything else works the same, including the used attributes and situational modifiers of the respective Specialty.\\
	With the GM's accordance, a character may even attempt a Profession check if he does not have the respective Profession (and thus a Profession rating of 0).
	In such a case, the player takes a -10 modifier on the roll and he may only achieve a Partial Success - never a Full Success.

	\begin{DndSidebar}{Profession Check Example}
	\textit{Inquisitor Otto Brecht has been trapped into a hive corridor with all doors locked. The straight forward Inquisitors decides to try and force open one of the doors with his own strength, hoping to still remain his covert approach that way. If that fails, he can still blast open the doors with a grenade after all ...\\
	\noindent
	Brecht is not particularly skilled at breaking things - he relies on the brute Nic'Or for such things - but he is keeping himself in top physical condition and is tough as nail. He should have a good enough chance to break open the doors...}\\
	\noindent
	That is, Brecht does not have the Break Specialty of the Athlete Profession, but he does have two ranks each in the Triathlete and Endure Specialties of that Profession. Thus, his Athlete Profession rating is: $2*4=8$.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Specialty / Profession:} Break / Athlete
		\item \textbf{Specialty Modifier:} 0 (untrained => use Profession)
		\item \textbf{Profession Rating:} 8
		\item \textbf{Attributes:} Power 37, Toughness 44
		\item \textbf{Modifiers:} Locked Door (-10)
		\item \textbf{Target Numbers:} 35 (37+8-10), 42 (44+8-10)
		\item \textbf{Rolls:} 77 (no pass), 43 (no pass)
		\item \textbf{Result:} Failure
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{But the door won't budge. Going loud it is then. So be it. He never liked sneaking around anyway...}
	\end{DndSidebar}

\subsection{Advantage \& Disadvantage}\label{Synergy}
	In Grimdark many different Specialties can possibly be used to solve any given situation.
	But not every tool is able to solve any given problem in any situation equally well.
	To reflect this, the GM can decide whether a certain Specialty (or Profession for that matter) has either Advantage or Disadvantage (or neither) in any given situation.
	Only in extreme cases should a GM deny the use of a Specialty.
	Note that for combat Specialties, a set of rules is outlined in the \ref{combat_chapter}.

	Basically, once a player announces which Specialty he wants to use to solve any given situation, the GM should ask him-/herself the following question: "How adequate is the use of this Specialty in this situation?"
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Perfect Fit:} A character picking a perfectly fitting Specialty for a situation should be rewarded by giving it an Advantage to increase the odds of success - after all, the player did make a good call of situational judgement.
		\item \textbf{Uh, that's a bit of a stretch:} In such a case, the player should face an additional challenge, represented by a Disadvantage.
		\item \textbf{Seems Fine:} The Specialty is neither a particularly great fit nor is it a stretch, so no need for adjustments.
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{DndSidebar}{Advantage Example}
	\textit{Chasing after a suspect on foot after a thunderous vehicle chase, Inquisitor Brecht's retinue finds themselves in the depths of the underhive of Hive Secundus. Myriad tiny walkways stretch out in all directions, some collapsed, some haunted by mutants and others filled with toxic waste deposits. Following the target through this maze will be hard. Syna, the Inquisitor's assassin sights at finding herself in a place way too familiar to her hated birthplace again.}\\
	\noindent
	That is, some of the team needs to pass a Navigate Enclosed test with a -20 difficulty to plot a (somewhat) safe route after the target. Syna's player notes that Syna's homeworld is a Hive world (and she did not pick a Noble background) too. GM and players agree that this is worth an Advantage on the Navigation test.\\
	\noindent
	\textit{But duty is duty and she is more likely than not the most familiar with the particularities of such a place. She sniffs the stale, stinking air and then leads the others down a side corridor.}
	\end{DndSidebar}

		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	Below follows the entries of the different Professions. 
	All use a common layout, as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First in italics, a short description of the respective Profession is given, focusing on common appearance and behavior patterns of characters of that Profession.
		These should not be taken as strict guides but as more as helpful guidelines when creating and playing a character.
		\item Aptitudes: the here listed Aptitudes regulate how difficult it is for a given character to learn this Profession.
		\item Common Attributes: this ordered list provide an overview over the Attributes used by the Specialties associated with the Profession. 
		The further back an Attribute is listed, the fewer Specialties make use of it.
		This list is intended to be a guide for players following the Generalist path, so they know what attributes their characters will likely need when using the Specialty.
		\item Tags: A list of \nameref{Tags} the Specialties of this Profession cover.
		\item Specialties: An alphabetical list of Specialties associated with this Profession.
		Players following the Generalist Path may use this list as a reference to spark their creativity and problem solving approaches.
		\item Sample Consequences: a list of examples of what might happen when a character fails or get a partial success with consequences on a task using this Profession.
		\item Common Modifiers: a list of common modifiers that might situational apply when using this Profession.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Acrobat}\label{Acrobat}
		\textit{The character shows a high level of body control and tension. 
		His movements are fluid, every step measured, every gesture a study in precision.
		He is likely to possess quite some strength without appearing swollen with muscle and may appear lean or even slim without being sunken or weak.
		The character is likely to be considered handsome or even beautiful depending on the local beauty ideals and other people might react accordingly.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Precision OR Precision, Physical
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Precision, Speed, Toughness
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Problem Solving, Physical Defense, SUP

			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Adept}\label{Adept}
		\textit{Nothing easier than to recognize an Adept.
		Just make a false statement about some incredible niche tidbit and watch who is getting all twitchy and finally cracks up and starts berating and correcting your false claims for the next hour or five - there: easy.}
		\begin{DndReadAloud}
		\textbf{\underline{Rule Exception:} Using the Adept Profession Rating}\\
		As an exception to the normal rule, you cannot use your Adept Profession Rating instead of Adept Specialties, which you did not have learn yet. You can still use your Profession Rating instead of the Specialty modifier of a learned Specialty though.\\
		It simply does not make any sense for a learning scribe of the Administratum (who knows a lot about the Imperium of Man) to be an expert in Occult things or Xenology after all...
		\end{DndReadAloud}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Cunning, Intellectual
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Cunning, Instinct, Will
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Problem Solving, Support
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Classic Education, Imperium of Man, Occult, Shadow Organizations, Tactica Imperialis, Ways of Mars, Xenology
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Wrong Recollection: The character recalls a false information and is convinced of its truth until convinced or proven otherwise.
				\item Partial Recollection: The character recalls most of the wanted data, but for some (potentially critical) bit.
				\item It was the other Way Round! The character mixed two things up. 43 becomes 34. Left corridor becomes right corridor. Red cable becomes the green.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Common Lore: +10
				\item Uncommon Lore: -5
				\item Forbidden Lore: -15
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Athlete}\label{Athlete}
		\textit{The character is visibly strong and tough.
		He likely has great muscle mass and little to no fat deposits.
		Most people will expect the character to be a good warrior - which may influence the way they perceive the character and react to him.
		He may be physically intimidating to less strong characters even without meaning to.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Brutality OR Toughness, Physical
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Brutality, Toughness, Will
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Physical Attack, Physical Defense, Problem Solving
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Block, Brawl, Endure, Force, Run, Throw
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Torn Muscle: -5 to all future Athlete tests. Cumulative.

				\item High Gravity: -15
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Believer}\label{Believer}
		\textit{The character has strong beliefs, usually religious ones, that he is displaying openly.
		He may openly wear insignia or iconography associated with his beliefs or actively preach about his beliefs to other persons.
		Swaying the character to a new point of view or convince them to change a set course of action is generally a difficult prospect.}
		\begin{DndSidebar}{Various Beliefs}
			Players should note down what their character's belief actually is - both for themselves as a reminder and the GM to determine whether some use of the Believer skill is plausible or ill fitting.\\
			The basic assumption of Imperial characters with the Believer skill is that they follows some part of the Imperial Creed, which has the following key tenets:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The God-Emperor: is the one true god of humanity and always was, albeit he once walked among men before his ascension to the golden throne.
				\item Heresy: it is the divine duty of every faithful to purge the Heretic, beware the psyker and mutant and abhor the xeno.
				\item Obedience: it is the believers duty to obey the authority of the Imperial government and their superiors, as they speak with the Emperors name.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{DndSidebar}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Will, Social
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Will, Brutality, Cunning
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Mental Attack, Mental Defense, Support, Problem Solving
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Counsel, Faith, Inspire, Meditate, Preach, Sanctify
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Doubt: A sliver of doubt is enough to crack the firm belief. -5 on Believer checks for the remainder the scene.
				\item Shattered: The belief got shattered and makes it all but impossible to call on it for the remainder of the scene.
				\item Fanaticism: The Believer looses any sense of reality over the overpowering belief and cannot see reason. He is unable to use Rationalist skills for the remainder of the scene and his actions may overstep many boundaries he normally would not bend.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Corruption Points: -1 per CP the character or target has
				\item Betrayer Profession Rating: -1 per Betrayer Rating of the target
				\item Clashing Beliefs: -1 per Believer rating if the target has another belief tenet.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Betrayer}\label{Betrayer}
		\textit{The character is focused on his own personal benefit in any given situation and values other people only for the benefit he can gain from using them.
		The word of a Betrayer is worth as much as one might suspect and you better watch your goods when one is around.
		Of course it is far from easy to see a Betrayer for who he really is through the maze of twisted lies, half-truth and even physical disguises a Betrayer might wear.
		More often than not, a Betrayer has a likable face, his speech a honey-tinged sweet and his gestures inviting and calming - everything intended to lower suspicions and alertness.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Precision, Social
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:}  Precision, Speed, Cunning, Instinct
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Mental Attack, Mental Defense, Problem Solving, Support

			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Suspicious: Target becomes suspicious of the character. -5 for all future Betrayer checks. Cumulative.
				\item Caught Red Handed: target knows the target to be a Betrayer. All Betrayer checks fail for the remainder of the scene. May restrict future interactions.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Target Believer Rating: +1 per Believer Rating of the target when using the targets Beliefs against it
				\item Distracted Target: +15
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Commander}\label{Commander}
		\textit{The character is an imposing figure – not necessarily in a physical sense – but by the sheer air of authority and determination that is nearly palpable around him.
		Commanders usually come in three variants: those who are deeply trusted by their comrades, those who are feared by them and those who seriously outSmarts them.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Will, Social
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Will, Brutality, Cunning
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Mental Attack, Support
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Loyalty, Pull Rank, Rally, Tactical Insight
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Grudging Obedience: The instruction does not go down well with the troops, lowering morale. -5 to all future Command skill checks for the remainder of the scene.
				\item Misinterpreted Command: The instruction was unclear or the receiver decides to misinterpret it. The target does not what it was instructed to do within the bounds of the command and circumstance.
				\item Disobedience: The target simply denies the instruction. This is practically mutiny! Cannot use Command Specialties on the target until the issue is resolved.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Dangerous Command: -5 (or worse)
				\item Simple Command: +5 (or better)
				\item Complex Command: -5 (or worse)
				\item Target is Superior: -10
				\item Target is Subordinate: +10
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Enforcer}\label{Enforcer}
		\textit{The character is a hardened man, used to get his way and his orders being followed. 
		He is well used and most likely feared for his scrupulous ways and words let alone the punishment he has ever ready for those that deny him.
		To stand up to an Enforcer is to face a brutal torturer of mind, body and soul. 
		Most cannot withstand the unforgiving, razor sharp gaze from an Enforcer's cold eyes let alone keep their wits when he starts shouting.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Brutality OR Instinct, Social
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Brutality, Instinct, Cunning, Will
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Mental Attack, Problem Solving, Support
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Blackmail, Integrity, Interrogate, Terrify, Torture
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lingering Dislike: The target remembers the threats and actions against him by the character and will be harder to interact with in the future. -10 on any Spokesman, Commander skill checks until resolved.
				\item Growing Resolve: The target is growing more resilient against the threats and actions of the Enforcer. -5 on Enforcer checks for the remainder of the scene.
				\item Empty Threats: The target has drawn the conclusion that the Enforcer's threats are null and empty. Future Enforcer checks fail until resolved.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Subject feels inferior: +10
				\item Subject feels superior: -10
				\item Subject fears worse if he gives in: -15 
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Ghost}\label{Ghost}
		\textit{The character is easy to oversee and forget.
		He may have the habit of staying in the back and keeping quiet.
		Maybe he has an unremarkable face and voice.
		Or maybe he is just extremely able to blend in with his surrounding, be it a jungle or a crowded street.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Precision, Instinctual
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Precision, Instinct
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Problem Solving
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Hide, Shadowing, Sneak, Vanish
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What was that?: Target learns the coarse location of the character without knowing details. -5 on Ghost checks until resolved.
				\item Spotted: The target has spotted the character and is focused on him. All future Ghost checks (expect Vanish) fail until resolved (e.g. by using Distract/Spokesman or Maneuvering/Acrobat)
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Paranoid target: -10
				\item Distracted Target: +15
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Gunman}\label{Gunman}
		\textit{The character is well versed in the usage and basic maintenance of firearms of different kind.
		It is very likely that he is carrying one or multiple guns - whether openly or covert - and would feel positively naked when not.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Instinct OR Precision, Physical
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Precision, Instinct, Brutality, Cunning
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Physical Attack, Mental Attack, Problem Solution
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Central Mass, Saturation Fire, Snap Shot, Sniping, Trick Shot, Walking Fire
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Glancing Hit: not a miss but also not a direct hit - target take half damage.
				\item Malfunction: The weapon has a malfunction - you should take better care of it! Roll on the Malfunction Table.
			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Difficult Weather: -10
				\item Target is moving quickly: -10 (or worse)
				\item Target Size
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Medic}\label{Medic}
		\textit{The character is likely lean and may have rings under his eyes from working countless over-hours in a hospital of sorts.
		Most Medics have delicate and dexterous fingers coupled with sharp eyes and a bright mind.
		More often than not, a Medic is quick to act for hesitation is ill at place when lives are at stake.
		And then there is that aura of competence and calm around them, that marks them out more than any of the above.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Precision OR Cunning, Intellectual
			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Cunning, Precision, Instinct
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Problem Solving, Support

			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Clipped Nerve: target suffers -5 on all Precision tests for the remainder of the scene
				\item Bleeding: target suffers from a light bleeding
				\item Arterial Spray: the character is it by a spray of arterial blood from his patient and must pass an Endure check or suffer a strong immune reaction during the next scene, which causes a -10 penalty to all tests
				\item Non-Sterile Treatment: the patient must pass An Endure check or succumb to an infection in the next scene, which cause a -10 penalty on all checks. If not treated, this may prove fatal.
				\item Finger Cut: character cuts himself during treatment and suffers from a light bleeding.
			\end{itemize}

			\begin{itemize}

			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

			\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Instinct, Cunning
			\item \textbf{\nameref{Tags}:} Problem Solving, Support
			\item \textbf{Specialties:} Enclosed, Surface, Void, Warp
			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:}

				\item Difficult Path: The route the character leads to, has a couple of difficulties, which may require additional checks fitting to the environment.
				\item Lost: The character has completely lost orientation and may end in a totally different location than he wanted to.

	 \subsection{Observer}\label{Observer}
		 \textit{An old saying goes as follow: it takes a good Observer to notice an Observer.
		Keen senses, long experience and good instincts come together to form an Observer.
		You may notice that first thing he does when walking into a room is looking around with practiced eye movements or that small smirk on his face when he sees through one of your bluffs - that is if you're lucky and he is not good at hiding those minute movements.}

	 \subsection{Operator}\label{Operator}
		 \textit{Daring and skilled drivers, pilots and helmsman more often than not have a tendency for bragging, swearing and partying.

		 	\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:}

		 		\item Safety Protocols Activated: Now the character has gone too far and tasked the vehicle a bit too much. Some safety feature has activated to prevent permanent damage and is reducing some of its features for the time being. -5 to future Operator skills for the duration of the scene.
		 		\item Lost Control: the character momentarily looses control over his vehicle. Depending on the situation this might cause anything from a short moment of panic all the way up to a (dangerous) crash.
		 		\item Crash: the character did not manage to evade a potential crash and the vehicle is hitting an obstacle at speed. Oh-Oh...
		 	\end{itemize}

	 \subsection{Rationalist}\label{Rationalist}
		 \textit{True Rationalists are a rare breed in the grimdark future but yet they exist and try their utmost to unravel the mysteries of the universe with but their sharp minds, pointed questions and clever methods.
		 More often than not, a Rationalist will show great interest in the "why" of any given situation.
		 Others love to berate these around them and take any chance to share their knowledge and understandings of literally anything thy might encounter.}

		 	\end{itemize}
		 \end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Spokesman}\label{Spokesman}
		\textit{Every word coming from your mouth is well balanced, well pronounced ... and it just feels right.
		Often enough, the smooth talk is coupled with a spotless appearing starting with a nice and well fitting dress or suite, creating an utterly respectable combination most people are more than ready to listen to and accept prompts, hints, recommendations or even well-meaning criticism.}

			\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:} 
			\begin{itemize}

				\item Ignored: The target is done with the character and does not care for his words any more, regardless how pretty they may be. All Spokesman checks fail for the rest of the scene.

		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Survivalist}\label{Survivalist}
		\textit{Noticing a Survivalist in a civilized environment is not easy.
		Maybe he has the habit of checking his surrounding nearly as careful as an Observer or has the habit of carrying around lots of baggage - just in case.
		But once you are in a desolate place, far from the benefits of civilization, there is no denying the aura of calm and competence of a true Survivalist.
		While you may worry about the dangers of the wilderness (which may also apply to what is left in the ruins of a civilized place), including thirst, hunger and wild animals, the Survivalist just seems ... home at last.}

			\end{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Alien Environment: -15

	\subsubsection{Technologist}\label{Technologist}
		\textit{The marvel of Technology are beyond the grasp of the vast majority of humanity.
		But not for a Technologist.
		His is the task of maintaining, repairing and even creating the advanced technology without which humanity would be all but doomed in the grimdark future.
		Many feel such a deep connection to technology, that they surround themselves with it permanently - in the shape of mechanical augmentations and a flurry of gadgets, some hardwired to their body some only a swift grip away.}

				\item How does this even work: The character is confused by the inner workings of the target. He may use it (unless its broken) but he cannot attempt modifications or repairs until he figures it out, usually by passing a Calculus/Rationalist check.

			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Tinkerer}\label{Tinkerer}
		\textit{Lacking thorough understanding of technology did never hinder people from using it.
		A Tinkerer is just one of those - he may use tech on a daily basis, maybe even some rather advanced tech, but all he knows is how to use it, in the way he was once taught to - or even figured it all by out himself.
		Many Tinkerers proudly show off their skills, hoping to impress more careful people around them.
		And despite this being close to (or even definite) tech heresy, many Tinkerers fiddle around with common day or even advanced tech in their free time.}

	\subsubsection{Trader}\label{Trader}
		\textit{For a Trader, everything is about money, influence, debt, credit and power.

	\subsubsection{Warrior}\label{Warrior}
		\textit{As a master of close-combat fighting, Warriors have a very real sense of danger around them.
		Whether they are fast and lean or brutally strong fighters does matter little, their posture tell the same story: 
		I am ready to kill you with a spoon, so do not mess with me.}
