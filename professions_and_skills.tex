\chapter{Professions \& Specialties}
Grimdark's skill system is divided into so-called Professions, which group associated Specialties together. Raising a certain Specialty will also raise the profession rating, which can be used in place of any Specialty of a Profession. 
This represents the fact that specialists are also (somewhat) proficient in their general field of expertise.\\
A renown surgeon for cybernetic replacements is certainly also quite capable at first aid treatments after all, and a famous climber is quite likely a dangerous wrestler as well...
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{DndReadAloud}
	{\large\textbf{Generalist or Specialist Path?}}

	The number of Specialties featured in Grimdark is quite large (and might even grow in your game!), so it is easy to feel overhwelmed.
	It is totally acceptable to completely set aside Specialties for your first (or any) character and only use the more general Professions instead! Grimdark calls this the \textbf{Generalist} path.
	Whenever the GameMaster calls for a Specialty check, he should also announce the respective Profession.
	If you choose to follow the Generalist path, you will just make the respective Profession check and you're good - the GM will apply the respective Modifiers of the Specialty and resolve the action.

	Should you prefer the delve deeper into Grimdark's skill system and manage each individual Specialty, you are set to follow the \textbf{Specialist} path.
	The Specialist path provides the option to fiddle with every last bit of your character, and can be seen as a tool for advanced players (or those who like a complex system) to tweak and customize their characters even further and make them truly unique.

\section{Professions} % (fold)
\label{sec:professions}
A Profession represent the generalist ability of a character in a certain broad area of expertise.
Each Profession covers a range of Specialties which are somewhat related.
In addition, they provide a fast and loose overview of the character.
Is he a brutal underhive ganger with high scores in the Betrayer, Athlete and Warrior professions?
Or an ancient tech priest with a more accumulated knowledge in his left (augmented) toe, than a handful of highborn nobles put together, reflected by his  Tinkerer, Technologist and Logic professions?
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{DndSidebar}{Profession Example}
	\textit{Sister Aryanna of the Ordo Dialogis and her death-cult comrade Krill'Ta are attempting to infiltrate a gathering of noblewomen of the Hive World Olrabus, suspecting the machinations of a genestealer cult in its midst. As a distrustful guard is denying them entrance, a hasty debate between the two members of the Inquisitors retinue using Ordo hand signs erupts. Should Aryanna attempt to tell a convoluted (and utterly crafted) story to convince the guard - or should Krill'Ta attempt to seduce the guard with her death world charm?\\
	Both would be valid approaches, but seducing the guard may take Krill'Ta out of the next scene and leave the sister alone in the midst of the noblewomen. On the other hand, sister Aryanna isn't particular known for her abilities to lie - an ability which is far from well-perceived by her Ordo after all...\\}
	\end{DndSidebar}
\end{figure}

One central decision of Grimdark, contrary to many other game systems, is the fact that it does not assume that player characters or even a group of player characters, cover all or even most professions. 
There are many different ways to tackle any given situation scattered over the different professions that may appear redundant on a purely mechanical take.
But each profession has its very own take and spin on "their" solution to a problem, along with certain role-play implications, limitations and situational modifiers.
Thus a certain given situation may be much easier to solve by one profession than by another - yet they all have their uses, without forcing someone to break out of character to tackle a certain solution.

On a mechanical level, Professions work (mostly) like Specialtes, with the main difference is the fact that you cannot raise Professions directly and use a different modifier.
The roll modifier when using a Profession is determined by the current Profession rating (see below).

\begin{figure}[hb]
	\begin{DndReadAloud}
	\textbf{Design Decision: Professions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Facilitate Player Creativity}: If a player has an idea, which is not covered by the existing Specialties, it is usually easy to discern the Profession to which the described action relates. Having the option to roll a Profession check in such a case, allows for great player creativity. GM and Players are encouraged to develop new Specialties for commonly used actions of players that are not foreseen by Grimdark.
		\item \textbf{Make Everyone a Generalist}: In many skill-based game systems, players may end up with specialist characters which are very proficient in skill A but absolutely untrained in skill B, although the two skills are actually quite closely related. This does not make a whole lot of sense, as every specialist is also necessarily a generalist in his field of purview - at least to some degree.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{DndReadAloud}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Profession Rating}
Each profession has a certain Profession rating, representing the total ability of the character in that Profession. 
This rating \textbf{increases by 2 for each new Specialty level learned} in an associated Specialty.

\subsection{The Profession Check}
A Profession check works just like a Specialty check with a single difference.
Instead of using the respective Specialty modifier, it uses the Profession Rating.
Everything else works the same, including the used attributes and situational modifiers of the respective Specialty.\\
With the GM's accordance, a character may even attempt a Profession check if he does not have the respective Profession (and thus a Profession ratimg of 0).
In such a case, the player takes a -10 modifier on the roll and he may only achieve a Partial Sucess - never a Full Success.

\begin{figure}[hb]
	\begin{DndSidebar}{Profession Check Example}
	\textit{Inquisitor Otto Brecht has been trapped into a hive corridor with all doors locked. The straight forward Inquisitors decides to try and force open one of the doors with his own strength, hoping to still remain his covert approach that way. If that fails, he can still blast open the doors with a grenade after all ...\\
	Brecht is not particularly skilled at breaking things - he relies on the brute Nic'Or for such things - but he is keeping himself in top physical condition and is tough as nail. He should have a good enough chance to break open the doors...}\\
	That is, Brecht does not have the Break Specialty of the Athlete Profession, but he does have two ranks each in the Triathlete and Endure Specialties of that Profession. Thus, his Athlete Profession rating is: $2*4=8$.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Specialty / Profession:} Break / Athlete
		\item \textbf{Specialty Modifier:} 0 (untrained => use Profession)
		\item \textbf{Profession Rating:} 8
		\item \textbf{Attributes:} Power 37, Toughness 44
		\item \textbf{Modifiers:} Locked Door (-10)
		\item \textbf{Target Numbers:} 35 (37+8-10), 42 (44+8-10)
		\item \textbf{Rolls:} 77 (no pass), 43 (no pass)
		\item \textbf{Result:} Failure
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{But the door won't budge. Going loud it is then. So be it. He never liked sneaking around anyway...}

All use a common layout, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First in italics, a short description of the respective Professiin is given, focusing on common appearance and behavior patterns of characters of that Profession.

	\item Common Attributes: this ordered list provide an overview over the Attributes used by the Specialties associated with the Profession. 
	The further back an Attribute is listed, the fewer Specialties make use of it.
	This list is intended to be a guide for players following the Generalist path, so they know what attributes their characters will likely need when using the Specialty.
	\item Specialties: An alphabetical list of Specialties associated with this Profession.
	Players following the Generalist Path may use this list as a reference to spark their crearivity and problem solving approaches.
	\item Sample Consequences: a list of examples of what might happen when a character fails or get a partial succesa with consequences on a task using this Profession.

The word of a Betrayer is worth as much as one might suspect and you better watch your goods when one is around.
Of course it is far from easy to see a Betrayer for who he really is through the maze of twisted lies, half-truth and even physical disguises a Betrayer might wear.
More often than not, a Betrayer has a likable face, his speech a honey-tinged sweet and his gestures inviting and calming - everything intended to lower suspicions and alertness.}

		\item Misinterpreted Command: The instruction was unclear or the receiver decides to misinterpret it. The target does not what it was instructed to do within the bounds of the command and circumstance.

	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Common Modifiers:}

\subsubsection{Enforcer}\label{Enforcer}
\textit{The character is a hardened man, used to get his way and his orders being followed. 
He is well used and most likely feared for his scrupulous ways and words let alone the punishment he has ever ready for those that deny him.
To stand up to an Enforcer is to face a brutal torturer of mind, body and soul.

	\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Power, Social
	\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Power, Charisma, Offense, Finesse, Smarts

		\item Growing Resolve: The target is  growing more resilient against the threats and actions of the Enforcer. -5 on Enforcer checks for the remainder of the scene.

Most Medics have delicate and dexterous fingers coupled with sharp eyes and a bright mind.
More often than not, a Medic is quick to act for hesitation is ill at place when lives are at stake.

 \subsubsection{Observer}\label{Observer}
 \textit{An old saying goes as follow: it takes a good Observer to notice an Observer.
Keen senses, long experience and good instincts come together to form an Observer.
You may notice that first thing he does when walking into a room is looking around with practiced eye movements or that small smirk on his face when he sees through one of your bluffs - that is if you're lucky and he is not good at hiding those minute movements.}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Instincts, Subtlety
 	\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Instincts, Smarts, Finesse

 \subsubsection{Rationalist}\label{Rationalist}
 \textit{True Rationalists are a rare breed in the grimdark future but yet they exist and try their utmost to unravel the mysteries of the universe with but their sharp minds, pointed questions and clever methods.
 More often than not, a Rationalist will show great interest in the "why" of any given situation.
 Others love to berate these around them and take any chance to share their knowledge and understandings of literally anything thy might encounter.}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{Aptitudes:} Smarts, Knowledge
 	\item \textbf{Common Attributes:} Smarts, Instinct, Will
 	\item \textbf{Specialties:} Calculus, Cipher, Linguistic, Rationality
 	\item \textbf{Sample Consequences:}

 		\item Confused: The character does not manage to explain the problem with is knowledge and the methods of rationality. He will continue to think about the matter and will thus be distracted. -5 on any Smarts or Instinct based checks for the remainder of the scene.

\section{Specialties}% (fold)
\label{sec:Specialties}
Specialties represent a tightly defined action and are the central resolution mechanic used in Grimdark. 
Every Specialty is associated with a Profession.
Thus, Specialties are usually written like this: Pretty Words (Spokesman).
That is the name of a skill is followed by the respective Profession in parenthesis.

\subsection{Specialist Level}
Specialties can have one of five levels. The level of a specialty directly determines the Modifier of the Specialty check. With each level, this modifier increases by 5 to a maximum of +20. Should a character have a Profession rating that is higher than is specialist modifier, he may instead use his Profession rating.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} This is the base of all Specialties. The character is completely untrained in this specific task and thus takes a Penalty of -10.
	\item \textbf{Trained:} The character has some training in this Specialty and thus gets a +5 bonus on the task.
	\item \textbf{Experienced:} The character is competent in this Specialty and has a good chance to succeed at most tasks. He gets a +10 bonus.
	\item \textbf{Veteran:} The character has faced this task countless times and only few others are their better. He gets a +15 bonus.
	\item \textbf{Master:} The character has mastered this Specialty and there are virtually none more competent at it. He gets a +20 bonus.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subtle and Blatant Specialties}
\label{skill_types}
Grimdark uses two different type of Specialties: Subtle and Blatant.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Subtle Specialties} are (somewhat) covert or low-profile in manner and draw considerable less attention than Blatant Specialties. 
	Subtle Specialties produce less severe effects on a failure or partial success but in turn are slightly less likely to succeed and loose a Draw during an opposed test.\\
	Examples: Pretty Words (Spokesman), Disguise (Betrayer), Balancing (Acrobat), Snap-Shot (Gunner), Fencing (Warrior)

	\item \textbf{Blatant Specialties} are flashy, loud, extreme or all of them (and more) at once. 
	Using a blatant Specialty is nearly guaranteed to draw (potentially unwanted) attention.
	A Blatant Specialty will cause considerable effects on failure or partial success but has a higher chance to succeed and always win a Draw during an opposed test.\\
	Examples: Quarrel (Spokesman), Rally (Commander), Break (Athlete), Walking Fire (Gunner), Hammerblow (Warrior)
\end{itemize}
Some Specialties may be used in both Subtle or Blatant way, e.g. the Demolition (Tinkerer) skill. 
Discretely placing a bomb can be done in a subtle way, but using a charge to blow open a door and shake those within certainly can only be considered blatant.
The GM is the final arbiter when it comes to deciding whether a skill is used in a Blatant or Subtle way.
