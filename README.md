# Grimdark
Role-Play Game system for games set in the grim-dark fture of Warhammer 40k or other militaristic sci-fantasy settings. It is (very) loosely based on the RPG series of FantasyFlightGames (Dark Heresy, Deathwatch, Only War, etc) but has undergone major rework of nearly any aspect - more than enough to say that is a whole new system, rather than only a simple hack of a base game.
