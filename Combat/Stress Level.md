#CoreSystem #Combat #Stress 
## Overview
The Stress Level gives a broad, simple to track indicator of how bad things stand for a character, once he starts to accumulate [Stress](/Combat/Stress.md) and crossed over his [Resilience](/Combat/Resilience).
Simply put: the higher this number, the worse it gets.

Mechanically speaking, the Stress Level is used to determine the severity of any [Snap!](/Combat/Snap.md) the character suffers. The higher his Stress Level, the worse the Snap! he suffers get, as his body and mind simply cannot bear the strain put upon them and start to break down more and more.

## Levels of Stress
0. the character is fresh and well.
1.  the character has taken a beating and has already taken a (somewhat minor) Snap!. He may feel his strength starting to wane and his patience running thin.
2. the character is really starting to feel beat up by now. He has taken a minor and medium Snap! and his instincts start demanding for a rest of body and mind.
3. it is a wonder that the character is still going at all. He has taken a severe, potentially permanent Snap!
