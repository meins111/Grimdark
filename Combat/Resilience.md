#CoreSystem #Stress #CharacterSheet #Combat 
## Overview
The amount of Stress a character can take without taking a negative effect ([Snap!](/Combat/Snap.md)) from it.
The value is derived from the character's [Will](/CoreSystem/Attributes/Will.md) and [Toughness](/CoreSystem/Attributes/Toughness.md) modifiers added together. 

Rarely, items or effects may add or subtract from a character's Resilience, like (combat) drugs, mutations, advanced technology (e.g., cybernetics) and warp powers.

## Resilience Score
>Resilience = Will (Mod) + Toughness (Mod)

## The End of Resilience
When a character has accumulated more [[Stress]] than his [[Resilience]], the following consequences occur:

1. The character reduces his Stress by a number of points equal to his [[Resilience]] and increases his [[Stress Level]] by one.
2. The character suffers a [[Snap!]], with a severity of (at most) his current [[Stress Level]]. The source of the latest source of Stress damage (e.g. the "attacker") gets to pick the actual  [[Snap!]] effect.
3. If the character's Stress is still larger than his Resilience, goto Step 1.
