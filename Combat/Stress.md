## Overview
Grimdark uses a single, combined value to indicate the sum of physical injury, exhaustion, illnesses as well as mental or psychological trauma, strain or pressure. 

Stress accumulates until a character's [Resilience](/Combat/Resilience.md) is overflowing, which then resets, increase his [Stress Level](/Combat/Stress%20Level.md) and make him suffer a [Snap!](/Combat/Snap.md) - a negative condition chosen by the latest source of Stress.


## Sources of Stress
The grimdark future is rich in sources of Stress. 
- Hostile environmental conditions (heat, cold, toxic, high gravity, radiation, fire, lack of air), heavy physical labor or exercise and of course combat are common sources of physical Stress. 
- Interrogation, heated debates, social or psychological pressure, mind affecting drugs, poisons and warp powers are all affecting the mental stability.

> [!faq]- Why combine physical and mental Stress?
> 1. It's easier than to track two values!
> 2. It allows interesting "cross effects", like a physically weakened target being easier to mentally influence or a target with weak morale who simply cannot stand physical harm.


## Taking Stress Damage
1. Add Stress on top of your current Stress value.
2. Check if your new Stress is higher than your [Resilience](/Combat/Resilience.md). If not - you are done.
3. Reduce your Stress Level by your Resilience.
4. Increase your [Stress Level](</Combat/Stress Level.md>) by one
5. The Source of the Stress (e.g. the 'attacker') may inflict a [Snap!](/Combat/Snap.md) on you.
6. Goto Step 2 _(yes you can suffer more than one Snap! in one go if the damage is high enough!)_
