#Stress #CoreSystem 
## Overview
Snaps are detrimental effects applied to an entity, typically after it has accumulated more [Stress](/Combat/Stress.md) than his [Resilience](/Combat/Resilience.md). 
They are grouped into three Tiers, each progressively worse in effect and more difficult to get rid off. 
Snaps can be either physical or mental in nature, depending on the source which caused it.

> [!faq]- Design Goals: Snaps
> Snaps are intended to present both the GM and players with a highly flexible, versatile framework to get creative during play and attach weight (and potentially lasting impact) to difficult scenes.
> When choosing a Snap!, players (and GMs) are granted a lot of narrative power, as the choice may shape the current scene - potentially in a drastic way and may leave permanent marks on entities.

## Mental & Physical Snaps
Snaps can be either physical or mental in nature, depending on the source which inflicted it. Some sources my even allow the "attacker" to choose either form. Beside the narrative aspect, the distinction is most important for determining which [Recovery Specialty](/SkillSystem/Tags/Recovery.md) would be most appropriate. It simply does not make a whole lot of sense for even the most skilled Counselor to treat a badly bleeding gunshot wound.

## Bad, Worse, Horrible
Grimdark uses three Tiers of Snaps, each progressively worse than the previous one. Typically, an entity will go through them in sequence by accumulating more and more [Stress](/Combat/Stress.md), but sometimes, particularly deadly attacks may also apply a Snap! (of a certain Tier) directly, regardless of the entities current [Stress Level](/Combat/Stress%20Level.md).

The three Tiers are as follows:
1. Tier: **Hurt**. A temporary but certainly painful, distracting and weakening consequence of the last source of Stress.
2. Tier: **Wound**. 
3. Tier: **Scar**.

## Recovering from Snaps
Lower tier Snaps typically have a limited duration or are fairly easy to treat. Tier 2 and 3 Snaps are another matter and typically require a specific [Recovery Specialty](/SkillSystem/Tags/Recovery.md) to treat and alleviate, for example Surgery [Medic](/SkillSystem/Professions/Medic.md). Some, Tier 3 Snaps in particular, may even require additional setup, roleplay, acquisitions or other extraneous actions to resolve properly, such as the need to acquire a good quality cerebral implant to treat a horrific head injury (without loosing most of ones personality in the process).
