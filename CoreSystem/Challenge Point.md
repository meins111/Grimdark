#CoreSystem 
## Overview
Challenge Points (CP) are used to compare the results of two parties during an [Opposed Check](/CoreSystem/Opposed%20Check.md), the more you get the more likely you are to beat your opponent. They are most prominently gained from the [Basic Check](/CoreSystem/Basic%20Check.md) which is rolled as part of the Opposed Check. 
Additionally, [Advantage](/CoreSystem/Advantage.md) and [Disadvantage](/CoreSystem/Disadvantage.md) both modify your CP as do some other, rare sources (like advanced [Aces](/LevelUp/Ace.md) or psychic powers).

## Getting Challenge Points
* Based on your [Trinary Outcome](/CoreSystem/Trinary%20Outcome.md):

|Outcome | CP |

|Critical Fail | -3 |
|Fail | -1 |
|Partial Success| +1 |
|Full Success| +3 |
|Critical Success| +5 |

|[Advantage](/CoreSystem/Advantage.md) | +2 |
|[Disadvantage](/CoreSystem/Disadvantage.md) | -2 |
