## Overview
Many checks in Grimdark are Opposed, pitting your Character against some kind of opposing force, usually a (hostile) entity. It may be as straight forward as crossing blades with each other or as intricate as a lengthy exchange of philosophical arguments to proof their respective actions being legimit.

## Opposed Check Mechanic
An opposed Check is resolved as follows:

1. Both parties choose an appropriate [Specialty](/SkillSystem/Specialty.md) (or a [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md) to use as a [Profession Check](/SkillSystem/Professions/Profession%20Check.md Check.md>)).
2. Both parties roll a [Basic Check](</CoreSystem/Basic Check.md>) and get a number of [Challenge Points (CP)](</SkillSystem/Challenge Point.md>)
3. Whichever side gets more CP wins the opposed check

## Determining the Scale of Victory
Typically the scale of the success is important to determine the effects and roleplay implications. This is done by determining the total number of [Victory Points](</SkillSystem/Victory Points.md>) the winner achieved as follows:

1. Determine Excess CP of the check. (Simply substract the CP of the loosing party from your own)
2. Add any VP modifiers on top
