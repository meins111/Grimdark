#CoreSystem 
## Overview
Many checks in Grimdark are Opposed, pitting your Character against some kind of opposing force, usually a (hostile) entity. It may be as straight forward as crossing blades with each other or as intricate as a lengthy exchange of philosophical arguments to proof their respective actions being legimit.

## Opposed Check Mechanic
An opposed Check is resolved as follows:

1. Both parties choose an appropriate [Specialty](/SkillSystem/Specialty.md) (or a [Profession](/SkillSystem/Profession.md)) to use in the opposed check.
2. Both parties roll a [Basic Check](</CoreSystem/Basic Check.md>) and get a number of [Challenge Points (CP)](</CoreSystem/Challenge Point.md>)
3. Whichever side gets more CP wins the opposed check

> [!example]- Opposed Check Example
>_Lizz tries to seduce a palace guard, with her best sweet talk and quite striking figure, into giving up some of the security codes of the palace's outer perimeter. The palace guard passively resist with the ingrained loyalty of his posting._
> - Lizz is using her Seduce (Spokesman) Specialty, which she has trained at Rank 3. Meanwhile, the guard resists with his Loyalty (Commander) Specialty of Rank 2.
> - Both roll their chosen Basic Test (she rolls for Seduce, he for Loyalty).
> - Lizz gets a Partial Success (1CP)
> - And so does the Guard (1CP)
> - The GM reveals that Lizz has Advantage because the guard has long since felt the attention of a beautiful lady and is this easily enthralled (+2CP for Lizz)
> - Lizz compares her CP (3) with that if the Guard (1): she has won the opposed test!


## Determining the Scale of Victory
Typically the scale of the success is important to determine the effects and roleplay implications. This is done by determining the total number of [Victory Points](</CoreSystem/Victory Points.md>) the winner achieved as follows:

1. Determine Excess CP of the check. (Simply subtract the CP of the loosing party from your own)
2. Add any VP modifiers on top to get the final


> [!example]- Opposed Check Example (cont.)
> Lizz wants to know just how much pressure she put on the guard and whether she has to go further or not 
> - Her excess CP are 2. Her 3 minus the one the guard got 
> - Lizz reminds the GM of her expensive and quite showing clothes as well as the special parfum she is wearing tonight. The GM awards her 2 additional VP for her preparations.
> Lizz has won the opposed test by a total  4 VP
