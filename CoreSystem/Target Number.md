#CoreSystem 


## Overview
The Target Number (TN)  determines the difficulty of a [Basic Roll](</CoreSystem/Basic Roll.md>). The higher the TN, the more likely it is for the roll to succeed - as you will need to roll **below or equal** to the TN on a d100.

## Determining the TN
In most cases, the TN is based on a character's [Attribute](/CoreSystem/Attribute.md) and may be modified by situational modifiers.
