#CoreSystem 


## Overview
The Target Number (TN)  determines the difficulty of a [Basic Roll](</CoreSystem/Basic Roll.md>). The higher the TN, the more likely it is for the roll to succeed - as you will need to roll **below or equal** to the TN on a d100.

## Determining the TN
Unless otherwise noted by your GM, the TN is based on a character's [Attribute](/CoreSystem/Attribute.md). 
> [!faq] Sample TN
> Using a Specialty relying on your character's Toughness Attribute (which is 37) will mean an (unmodified) TN of 37.
