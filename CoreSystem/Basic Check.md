## Overview
The central resolution mechanic of Grimdark. It combines two [Basic Roll](</CoreSystem/Basic Roll.md>)s, each against a different Target Number to produce a [Trinary Outcome](</CoreSystem/Trinary Outcome.md>).

Usually, the Target Numbers are two of the character's [Attribute](</CoreSystem/Attribute.md>)s, as is the case for all Specialities and Profession Checks. In some cases, other values (e.g. [Item Rating](</Armoury/Item Rating.md>) or [Durability](<Armoury/Durability.md>)) are used. One example of this is the [Armor Save](</Combat/Armor Save.md>).

## Trinary Results

>[!Basic Check Example]-
>_Sergej, the ex-guardsman and newest member of I quisitor Brecht's warband, is currently fleeing for his life in a hijacked cargo-eight truck from a bunch of horrifying mutants. During the chase, he suddenly finds himself on a one-way lane rushing towards a bridge spanning two hive blocks... A bridge in the process of being raised in an attempt of the local enforcers to cordon off the sudden outbreak of disorder in Block 87.
>A cold moment of existential fear later, Sergej decides that he simply has to take the risk of a jump and floors the accelerator, trying to squeeze every last iota of speed out of the battered old engine he can._
>* The GM calls for a [Chasing (Operator)](/SkillSystem/Specialties/Chasing) check
>* This Specialty relies on the character's **Precision** and **Instinct** attributes
>* Sergej's Precision is 42 and his Instincts are 39
>* Sergej has the Specialty trained at Rank 2, which gives him a +10 modifier to both rolls 
>* So the Target Numbers are: 42+10=52 and 39+10=49
>* Sergej's player rolls: 12 ''(Pass)'' & 64 (''No Pass'')
>* This means the Check is a ''Partial Success''!
>
>_Sergey pushes the old engine to it's limit with precisely timed shifts and accelerations but he misjudged the height difference between the two bridge parts by quite a bit...
>With a bone jarring crash the cargo-eight lands on the far side of the closing bridge. But Sergej notices immediately that the truck now steers like a Jellyfish and that he is rapidly loosing speed. Clearly something in the old truck has broken._
>
>* The GM informs Sergej's player that all future Checks to operate the stolen Cargo-Eight will have a -10 penalty and he will be at a Disadvantage in all opposed checks.
