Grimdark's core is a d100 based roll-under system. This means you will roll d100's and aim to roll under a given target number (ranging from 0-100). This target number usually is one of your character's [Attribute](<CoreSystem/Attribute.md>).

* [Basic Roll](<CoreSystem/Basic Roll.md>) - the fundamental d100 dice roll used by Grimdark
* [Basic Check](<CoreSystem/Basic Check.md>) - for a check, the most common resolution mechanic you will encounter, you roll two Basic Roll to get a [Trinary Outcome](<CoreSystem/Trinary Outcome.md>)
* [Opposed Check](<CoreSystem/Opposed Check.md>) - when an action is directly opposed by an opposing force, e.g. during combat, opposed checks are rolled.
