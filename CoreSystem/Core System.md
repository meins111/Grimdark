Grimdark's core is a d100 based roll-under system. This means you will roll d100's and aim to roll under a given target number (ranging from 0-100). This target number usually is one of your character's [[Attribute]].

* [[Basic Roll]] - the fundamental d100 dice roll used by Grimdark
* [[Basic Check]] - for a check, the most common resolution mechanic you will encounter, you roll two Basic Roll to get a [[Trinary Outcome]]
* [[Opposed Check]] - when an action is directly opposed by an opposing force, e.g. during combat, opposed checks are rolled.
