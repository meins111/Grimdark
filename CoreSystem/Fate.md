*/Fate is a frickle friend. As likely to tip the balance in your favour as it is to make your carefully planned operation go off the rails in the most spectacular manner.._*

## Fate Dice
* A Fate Dice is a [Basic Roll](</CoreSystem/Basic Roll.md>) which comes up with double digits (e.g. 11, 22, 33, ..., 99, 100)
* Fate acts as an Augmenter. Good rolls become great, bad rolls become ruinous.
* In particular, a Fate Dice may turn a simple Failure into a Critical Fail and a Full Success into a Critical Success. (See: [Trinary Outcome](/CoreSystem/Trinary%20Outcome.md))
* Depending on the Specialty in question, some additional effects may only trigger when a Fate Die is rolled

## Double Fate
* A [Basic Check](/CoreSystem/Basic%20Check.md) may come up with both rolls being a Fate Die
* This is very rare (less than 1%) and should cause a tremendous effect, memorable for all involved
