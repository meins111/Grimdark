#CoreSystem 
## Overview
Life is complicated. And life in the Grimdark future is very complicated. Reasons for complications range from a labyrinthine bureaucracy, failing ancient machinery, wide-spread corruption and self-servicing to intense fractioning, internecine conflict and foolhardy incompetence as well as the (understandably but annoying) tendency of an opponent to not get bested easily.

While playing Grimdark, you will get countless Complications, as the Partial Success is the most probable [Outcome](/CoreSystem/Trinary%20Outcome.md) for most characters. Thus, it is very important for GMs and players to understand the intent and scope of Complications, to keep the game fun and satisfying.

## Minor vs Major Complication
A [Partial Success](/CoreSystem/Trinary%20Outcome.md) will typically trigger a minor complication, while a full-blown Failure will give rise to a major complication. The latter one may turn out to be truly catastrophic in case of a Critical Failure.
- **Minor**: This is just a small annoyance that is typically easy to solve, especially with the help of others.
- **Major**: This is bad news and may require quite a bit of (hasty) improvising to fix, typically with the aid of others.
- **Catastrophic**: This will probably ruin your character's day and may be hard if not even impossible to fix, at least on your own.

## Fixing the Mess
Unless for extreme circumstances, typically arising from a catastrophic complication or a truly unsalvageable situation, your allies can help you recover or at least partially salvage a complication. Sometimes, with quick thinking and the appropriate skill you may even salvage the situation yourself.
1. **How**: The most common way to recover from a complication (or help your ally recover from one) is to succeed on a follow up [Basic Check](/CoreSystem/Basic%20Check.md) (sometimes it needs to be an [Opposed Check](/CoreSystem/Opposed%20Check.md) of course). 
2. **Who**: This check can be attempted by either yourself or, preferably, by a nearby ally. Who can or cannot do this check, depends wholly on the type of check that made the complication arise, disposition of character to allies and the overall scene. GMs are encouraged to allow other players to lend aid most of the time to facilitate teamwork.
	- Minor complications should allow for players to attempt and solve it themselves given they have a fitting specialty.
	- Severe complications should preferably be addressed by your allies. Attempting it yourself is only possible with GM permission (and a very good reasoning). Attempting it should be at a [/CoreSystem/Disadvantage](/CoreSystem/Disadvantage.md)
	- Catastrophic complications should only be salvageable by your allies and even then only with a shared effort and a good plan.
3. **Outcome**: Checks to salvage a complication should not produce complications of their own. 
	- On a partial success, the complication is either solved (most appropriate for minor complications) or mostly mitigated. 
	- A Failure does not make matters worse - that will only happen on a Critical Failure. 
	- Analogous, a Full Success simply salvages the complication while a Critical Success might even spin it in a beneficial direction.


> [!faq] Discussion: Complication-as-Prompt
> At the heart of it, a Complication is intended to be a prompt for roleplay. How a character or group reacts to a complication has great potential to establish and show group dynamics or character quirks. 
>  As such, complications should be viewed as an opportunity for:
> - another character to lend a hand in solving a task. This is a great way to let characters share the spotlight even if the current task is not part of their typical skill set.
> - you to take the problem in your stride. For this, you typically roll a different Check to smooth things over before the Complication becomes a problem. A great way to show off the proficiency of the character and let his diverse skill set shine.
> - you to get creative at circumventing it by using some environmental feature, a perfectly fitting trait or exceptional, creative idea for how to solve the arising issue (roleplay argument).

## Examples
> [!example]- Example Complications 1
> > _Jèrome is busy picking the lock of an old sewer access hatch, while Natàlia is nervously looking for signs of the mutants roaming these tunnels._
> - **Minor Complication:** _the hatch opens but Jèrome's tool slip his grimy hands and falls. If it clatters to the stone floor it may cause some noise that might alert anyone close by to their presence._
>   - Solution A: Natàlia tries to catch the falling tool with a deft reaction. She rolls an easy Acrobat check.
>   - Solution B: Jèrome tries to kick the tool off and into the sewer proper, where it certainly won't cause any ruckus (but loose him his tools). He rolls an easy Athletic check.
>   - Solution C: Jèrome points out that he had set down his backpack earlier to work more easily. Certainly the tool will fall onto it rather than the floor!
> - **Major Complication:** _the hatch lock turns out to be more than a match for Jèrome's attempts and frustrates him to the point that he violently curses, breaking the silence they kept up for the last hour. Shocked silence falls for a moment before the rapid taptaptap of running feet can be heard from a side corridor. They were heard by a small group of mutants!_
>   - Solution A: Natàlie decides that time for subtlety is over and slaps a detpack to the stalwart hatch. With a reverberating bang, the way is free but stealth will not be an option for some time.
>   - Solution B: They prepare to fight the mutants. As they round the corner, Jèrome and Natàlie note that thy are armed with looted powertools and one even has a lascutter. Those might come in handy later...
>   - Solution C: They run and hide from the alarmed mutants, ending up in a corridor that is not on their maps but which seems to lead in the direction they were meant to go...
> - **Catastrophic Complication:** _the hatch suddenly swings out with enough force to send Jèrome tumbling. Out bursts a massive mutant with four arms ending in claws and wide, gaping maw like that of a crocodile. Their prey found them first and they are in for a bad start!_
>   - Solution: not much to salvage here. Fight or flight.
