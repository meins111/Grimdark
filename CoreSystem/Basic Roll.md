## The Basic Roll
Virtually every resolution in Grimdark uses the same basic Roll:

>[!important]
>Roll one d100. To succeed it must roll under or equal a [Target Number](</CoreSystem/Target Number.md>)

Most often, two Basic Rolls are performed as part of a [Basic Check](</CoreSystem/Basic Check.md>) or [Opposed Check](</CoreSystem/Opposed Check.md>) where the Target Number is an [Attribute](</CoreSystem/Attribute.md>) adjusted by [Roll Modifier](</CoreSystem/Roll Modifier.md>).
