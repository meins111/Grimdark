#CoreSystem #TwoWaysOfPlay
## Overview
Grimdark offers two ways of building and playing characters. They are called the [Generalist](</SkillSystem/Generalist Playstyle.md>) and [Specialist](</SkillSystem/Specialist Playstyle.md>) paths.

In short, the Generalist Path does not track individual [Specialties](SkillSystem/Specialty.md) of a character. Using this playstyle, checks are always resolved using a [Profession Check](/SkillSystem/Professions/Profession%20Check.md>). This leads to a more simplistic gameplay compared to the Specialist Path. 

On the other hand, many players do enjoy the nitty-gritty of detailed character creation and development provided by the Specialist Path.

## Combining Playstyles
While the GM may decide to have everyone use one or the other Path, the big benefit of the two Playstyles lies in the fact that they can be combined seamlessly. Some players may adhere to the Specialist Path while the others use the Generalist Playstyle.
