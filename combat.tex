\chapter{Combat}
\textit{In the far future there is only war.}\\
While there are many situations that can be solved without fighting, practically any kind of situations can really, really quickly spiral out of control and bloodshed ensues. 
This chapter will introduce the important rules that govern combat in Grimdark, especially the interactions between various combat oriented \nameref{sec:Specialties}, how damage and wounds are handled and common situational modifiers.

\section{Life, Death \& Injury}
Characters in Grimdark face many different ways in which they can come to harm.
Enemies might shoot them, debris might crash on them or cruel foes might play mind tricks on them.
There are three major concepts that make up Grimdarks system of handling harm:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Resilience \& Stress:} Common physical injury and mental trauma are combined into a Stress value which rises and falls throughout a scene. A character's Resilience determine how much he is able to withstand.
	\item \textbf{Stress Level:} When the Stress value of a character rises above his Resilience, his Stress level increases by one and his Stress value and he takes a Snap (see below). The higher a character's stress level, the more severe the Snaps he will suffer.
	\item \textbf{Snap:} When Stress gets too much for a character's Resilience, he gains a Snap. This is a status effect or conditions applied by whatever caused the Stress to overflow. Usually, a Snap is only temporary.
	\item \textbf{Wound:} Sometimes a character might be subject to a really grievous hit which is nearly guaranteed to leave a lasting mark. Getting hit by a plasma gun for example. Wounds are permanent although some may be treated by a skilled Medic (or other means).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resilience}\label{Resilience}
Every character has an innate tolerance for mental and physical trauma.
Grimdark calls this tolerance \textbf{Resilience}.\\
A character's Resilience is the sum of a his Toughness and Will modifier.
\begin{DndComment}{Resilience}
	\textbf{Resilience = W-Mod + T-Mod}\\
	\textit{Example: Noc'Or has a Toughness score of 47 and a Will score of 33 - so his T-Mod is 4 and W-Mod is 3. The sum of those two is 7, which means Noc'Or has a Resilience of 7.}
\end{DndComment}

\subsection{Stress}\label{Stress}
When a character takes damage, regardless of its type, his Stress value increases.
Whenever this value increases above his Resilience three things happen:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item He takes a Snap determined by the source of the damage.
	\item His Stress Level increases by one.
	\item His Stress Value decreases by the character's Resilience. Should the new value still be above the character's Resilience, go to the first step.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{DndSidebar}{Example: Stress}
\textit{Sister Aryanna is fighting mutant rats invading her apothecarium through the cellar. She is squashing them one after the other the stock of her bolter, not wanting to waste precious bolt shells on such low creatures. Both her legs are already bloody from the scratching and gnawing rodents.}\\
\noindent
Aryanna has a Resilience of 6 and her current Stress is at 4 after taking several minute scratches and bites from the rats.\\
\noindent
\textit{Then, out of nowhere, a particular disgusting one jumps on her back and sink its teeth into her neck! She feels her strength leave her body along with the droplets of blood from the wound...}\\
\noindent
The surprise attack deals 4 damage, bringing Aryanna up to 8, which is more than her Resilience. 
Thus the following happens:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Aryanna take a Snap. The GM informs her player that Aryanna is now poisoned by the dirty fangs of the mutant rat. For now, the poison is only reducing her Power by 5 for the remainder of the scene.
	\item Her Stress Level increases by one. It is now 1.
	\item She reduces her stress value by her Resilience. This means her new Stress Value is: 8-6=2.
\end{enumerate}
\end{DndSidebar}

\subsection{Stress Level}\label{Stress_Level}
The current Stress Level of a character provides the player and GM a simple way of seeing how exhausted a character is.
It also presents a "danger meter" to the player, since the Snaps a character suffers gets progressively worse the higher his stress level goes.
The sample Snaps presented in various places throughout the book only cover the first three Stress Level.

But Grimdark does not use a strict limit for the amount of Stress Levels a character can accumulate.
GMs may allow players to "go beyond" those three levels, representing their characters pushing themselves beyond the safety margins erected by body and mind.
It is recommended that whenever a character reaches a new stress level beyond the third, he GM should request a Endure (or other fitting) check, to represent the character struggling to keep up the fight.\\
This decision is left to the individual GM and he may even decide to keep it situational - e.g. by allowing players a longer breath during climatic encounters than during common scenes.
